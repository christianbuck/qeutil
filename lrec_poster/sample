Oh great, now I want to go to Paris!
These are fabulous photos, I almost feel as if I'm there.
Just as well I'm not though, I don't think my bank account could take the strain!If you're ever down in Bristol I could show you a similar shop that sells old buttons, lace, faded photographs and other amazing treasures.
I really must go in and photograph it sometime soon.

With that click, I entered the technical age.
I was on the internet!
It took awhile to overcome my fear of the unknown while searching for my ancestors.
I kept repeating, "don't be afraid, just do it."
I cautiously checked out Family Search and Ancestry along with others.
Hey, I was catching on.
Then, in October, on Ancestry Message Boards, I found someone looking for "The Parents of Augusta Ballou."
The person inquiring was a Hubbard.
Augusta's two daughters married Hubbards.
The answer came from a Ballou descendant.
Really!
Could this be my great, great grandmother, Augusta Ballou Davidson?
I was also looking for her parents.
Although the messages were from 2002, I boldly answered.
Bingo!
I found Anne, the great, great granddaughter of Augustus, twin to my Augusta.
Dear, dear Cousin Anne opened up an entire new family for me.
I have been completely immersed in genealogy ever since that fateful October.
Ha!...Scary box, I conquered you!
I have much more as I have been focusing on this family for a long time and would be glad to exchange further information.

We think an entire GenY generation can be summed up with a two paragraph label like a box of Wheat Thins.

Allie: "But I do think that in case we can't change that, we should be prepared to pay more in taxes to support the millions of babies that will now be born to single mothers and mothers who give up their unwanted babies to the foster care system."Would you PLEASE stop repeating this as though you know what you're talking about?!
I am a biological mother, and a foster mother, and an adoptive mother.
No one "gives up their unwanted babies to the foster care system."
Unwilling mothers give up their babies to adoptive parents (which thousands and thousands of people would like to be).
Willing mothers either keep and raise their children, or have their children forcibly removed and placed into foster care as a result of abuse or neglect.
Women who want their babies keep them.
Women who don't want their babies abort the or adopt them out.
If there were no abortion, then women would either keep their babies or give them up for adoption.
Some of them would wind up in foster care, sure, but plenty of wanted babies wind up in foster care too.
You keep claiming that there's some kind of direct correlation between more abortion-less foster care, and that's utter crap.

My undergraduate honors thesis was titled: "Imperial Versus Indigenous: Language Usage and Cultural Identity" which looked at the use of English and Swahili in Kenya and French and Wolof in Senegal.
I found the topic wildly interesting, particularly the language usage in literature debate between famous Nigerian author Chinua Achebe (who I've mentioned before) and Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o.

METHODS
Delirium during hospitalization seems to be a strong, independent marker of high risk of mortality not just in the hospital, as indicated in previous research, but for at least 12 months after admission.
Furthermore, among patients with delirium only, those with more severe delirium symptoms had the highest mortality risk.
We were unable to directly assess the effect on mortality of the duration of delirium.
Our results suggest that delirium has a particularly strong effect on mortality among patients without preexisting dementia; the HR in this group (compared with subjects with neither delirium nor dementia) was 3.77 (95% CI, 1.39-10.20).
In contrast, among patients with preexisting dementia, there was a weaker, nonsignificant effect of delirium (and severity of delirium symptoms) on mortality.

Education: Many recent studies indicate the increase of our technology and requirements for jobs demand more attention given to improving our children's understanding and knowledge.
A variety of new educational techniques are now being developed (quantum learning, super memo, brain gym) all to improve our ability to function at new levels in the job market.
Were German education programs at that time so far off from what we are attempting now?
They were very enthusiastic about education as with everything else.
Was part of our misunderstanding and fearing them, because they saw this far into the future and knew the technology levels would be much higher, therefore the education level must also be higher?

You would assume wrongly, then - I've been to the one in Winchester VA in a few times with my inlaws - there was nothing remotely that interesting there - 8 flavors, of the chocolate, vanilla, strawberry variety.
Their website lists more exotics, but they certainly weren't there.
They certainly didn't have freshly shredded coconut or diced mangos like Whirled Peace has.
I wouldn't go Starbucks ever, given the choice, but I am familiar with their general musical aesthetic, which is, indeed, also largely awful pablum.
The Christianity thing is a huge turnoff to me, and indicative of a much greater problem I wouldn't place at their business's feet, exactly, but I guess your mileage may vary - I found it oppressive and cloying.

A judge officially counted 18 farmers killed, but local residents say many more were slain.

LIFESTYLEActress Appears Anywhere But `Arsenio`By JAY BOYAR, The Orlando Sentinel, August 30, 1991You can see Anne-Marie Johnson as Althea Tibbs on In the Heat of the Night, the hit NBC series that will enter its fifth season this fall.
And you can see her as the ingenue in Charles Lane`s True Identity, the zany comedy that opened Friday nationwide.
You also might catch the outspoken black actress on any number of talk shows around the country.
One place, however, you will not see Anne-Marie Johnson is on The Arsenio Hall Show.
"I did his show once and I`ll never do it again because it`s a very nasty atmosphere," said Johnson, 31.
"It was terrible.LIFESTYLEArsenio Hall Kicking Back In New RoleBy JAMES ENDRST The Hartford Courant, March 4, 1999Arsenio Hall is kicking back in his hotel room, and yet he seems to be a body in perpetual motion.
There's a yin and yang to it -- high-energy and low-key at the same time.
Maybe it's the East-meets-West influence of his role on CBS' Martial Law (Saturday nights), which he joined late last year.
As LAPD-spokesman-turned-cop Terrell Parker, Hall is what you'd have to call sidekick to martial arts and series star Sammo Hung, who plays Shanghai-supercop-turned-LAPD-law-enforcer Sammo Law.
Kicking butt wouldn't seem the most obvious or, for that matter, comfortable choice for Hall, a 40-year-old comedian/actor best known for cracking wise on his syndicated talk show from 1989 to 1994.

As the Crowe Flies (and Reads!)
Elements of Despacho: The two circles symbolize union as their shapes intertwine with each other.
The masculine is represented on the right where it energetically resides in our bodies.
White flowers indicate the heavens, celestial spirits and Apus or Mountains as we hold the spiritual masculine as residing above.
To the left the feminine is held in red flowers symbolic of the blood of Pachamama, Mother Earth, as we are spiritually held from the feminine below.
Within each circle is a seed of the other as shown by the red flowers of the feminine in the white flowers of the masculine and vice versa.
A feather sits in the masculine representing Air and Spirit while a shell representing water and Earth resides in the feminine.
Red and white candles in each circle symbolize the Sacred Fires of Passion that burn within the heart of the masculine and feminine.
All four elements are symbolized and brought to balance, Earth, Air, Water and Fire.
At the heart of our despacho is a bed of tobacco and sugar to hold our intentions which sit in the shell in the center, our intention to plant seeds of self love and bring internal balance and harmony to our Sacred Masculine and Feminine, heart and mind.
Two small figures of a man and a woman sit inside the shell.
A wreath of rosemary surrounds the flowers.

that some of the features in multiplayer, that they are trying out and basically experimenting with, may not ship with the final game.
I believe MP will be on disc.
They have not said otherwise as of yet. minimilan13 5pts WOW:D xenounknown4 5pts @RO-nIn187 by costumes the game that i had in my mind was DEAD SPACE 2 COLLECTORS COSTUME DEUS EX LIMITED GUNS AND ITEMS DRAGON AGE ORIGINS AND 2 JUST TO BE A LITTLE MORE PRECISE HAPPY NOW!!! xenounknown4 5pts @RO-nIn187 i was just referring to modern day games who claim to cover 13 16 or 20 hr game span and my point was that they will reduce the main campaign time (SINCE YOU WANT TO BE PRECISE) and i know costumes are cheats so wats the point of pre-ordering if u cant get any real benefit out of them i bought the ultimate edition and the ghost of sparta deimos costume as well that i will have fun with the costumes like in gow1 and 2 and fools like u who want everything in precise information i did get the platinum in my 2nd playthrough as well just check my psid of same name OH AND ONE MORE THING U MISSED THE POINT SO CHECK MY COMMENT AGAIN not explaining anymore!!!! gameguy182 5pts Ok Sony Santa Monica, you have my attention now unfortunately.
Grimmjowdenge 5pts So what if the multiplayer blah blah man God of War is a classic id play this thing no matter what!! wushdishmeen 5pts What he probably means by not guaranteeing it'll ship with the game is that they'll probably release multiplayer as a DLC or require some sort of a multiplayer pass like they did with Uncharted 3 Multiplayer and they just don't want to say anything until the last minute so they don't deter people away from it.
If so, that would be incredibly lame considering $60 is already too much for a video game that lasts 8 hours.
Plus it's not like you're benefiting from not purchasing the multiplayer as the game will still be $60.
So its basically you just lose out on content if you don't fork over another $10.
They should at least provide incentives for people to pay extra for a feature that has been packaged along with games for eternity.
Just having access to it isn't enough incentive.
They should give vouchers for free DLC content for both the single and multiplayer versions.
On a lighter note... the graphics look amazing and I'm a huge GOW fan.
All of them have been extremely well done and I can't wait to see the demo for the campaign of this game! devrindare 5pts Whatever comes from Sony for God of War series, I'll always like. wornstar moderatorstaff 5pts @dr_jashugan Unfortunately that was all Sony gave us.
No filming was allowed during the demo. dr_jashugan 5pts GS should have shown the complete demo instead of just small parts.: (atn98 5pts GOW-Ascension seems like a teaser for a GOW4 title they'll release with the PS4... why make a prequel if not for that reason ?
I don't feel like seeing Kratos wash the dishes and cook a turkey for his family.
But that's just me...
I guess it'll keep us occupied until GOW4... twztid13 5pts All that & he says it still may not be in the shipped game?
WTF?
Also, is this co-op or vs?
He says 4v4, then it shows characters kicking enemies off the ledge like a regular enemy.
I'm assuming another player wouldn't be thrown around that easy.
If it's PvP, they've lost me.
If it's co-op, this might be amazing. lilromeo0606 5pts This may be a perfect blend of single player action, and multiplayer insanity.
Parker7007 5pts [This message was deleted at the request of the original poster] Parker7007 5pts Holy sh*t!!!
My love for God of War was just reinvigorated.
I don't see why anyone would ever complain about the addition of MP.
It looks very well thought out already, not just thrown in unnecessarily.
Plus you don't need to play it if you don't want to.
It's God of War, of course the focus will still be the campaign.
I for one think this looks incredible! #1 game I'm looking forward to now!
Gam1nG_W1zard 5pts i swear gamers complain about everything...whats wrong with MP? they're jus tryna give u somethin 2 do after after the SP AluminumAndroid 5pts Tired of Kratos.
And multiplayer? seriously? *facepalm* RO-nIn187 5pts @xenounknown4 lol, i would have loved a 24h campaign, my fastest playthrough of gow3 was 6-7h, maybe even less, its been a while cant remember for sure... plus the costumes were cheats, so why enable trophies? i had all trophies after the 2nd playthrough w/o cheating, not that hard but i guess if it took you 24h to finish it thats almost impossible:P RO-nIn187 5pts damn that looked nice, especially the cyclops... but i'm still sceptic about the whole multiplayer part... well as long as the sp part stays true to the series it doesnt matter to me anyway:) davsonamission 5pts I think they should have waited till the PS4 came out and made this game a launch title ... metalgrinch 5pts So awesome to finally see a multiplayer not only with this much intense gore and violence, but also NO GUNS!
As a work in progress this looks incredible already!
Fooljeff 5pts [This message was deleted at the request of the original poster] Gamer_4_Fun 5pts I love the fact they are trying to make multiplayer fit in god of war, so far it looks great to me.
Dedakiss 5pts y must they shoe horn MP into every game now a days?
Assassins creed, Bio Shock, Mass Effect, Ninja Giadien, now this.
WTF?
When ever they split focus the game always seems to turn out less then stellar.
This is not a Shooter or RTS game, it doesn't need MP.
Why must they always give us what we weren't asking for Grovilis 5pts Hopefully they have more than a handful of different execution animations for the cyclops or it's going to get really old really fast. chilipepperman 5pts multiplayer looks fun nima_metal90 5pts I hate the multiplayer allready!
Just give me a good campaign.
Aentikraist 5pts thank the gods is only on the ps3 cause this one i want so badly to SKIP this game cmmon ill wait till GOW 4 or other non online game for the Vita no online ruining stuff come up anyway have fun:) ps3gamer1234 5pts Looks very gory and that's a good thing.

I appreciate all the efforts that the researchers put into the stats.
But hopefully, we can do something more with the numbers.
It is good to know about demographics and all those things that statistics can provide us, but I guess, finding a cure is more important.

Designed by Italian artist Giuseppe Moretti and cast from local iron in 1904, it has overlooked the urban landscape of Alabama's largest city since the 1930s.

The man accused of sexually assaulting a woman during a massage at the Mall of Abilene is not licensed by the state.Now the Texas Department of State Health Services is taking action against the man and the massage parlor he worked for.47-year-old Jingbo Xu was arrested Tuesday for allegedly groping a woman who had fallen asleep in a massage chair.A spokesperson for the state department says Xu is not a licensed massage therapist, and his employer, Li Sun Acupressure and Massage, does not have a massage establishment license.The state has now sent a letter for cease and desist.The spokesperson says if it doesn't happen, they will hand the issue over to local law enforcement.Under state law, failure to provide valid licensing is considered a criminal violation.

Sensing Kenpachii's actions from far away, Ruri'iro Kujaku praises the captain's abilities and notices a look on Yumichika's face, one which shows his fear as he gets close to death.
With that, Ruri'iro Kujaku wishes that he dies beautifully.
In response, Yumichika states his decision to defeat his Zanpakutō spirit, stating that he was worried about other people's thoughts over his power.
Suddenly, Yumichika releases a large quantity of his Reiatsu and attacks the vines of Ruri'iro Kujaku's Shikai with a mid-level Hadō, freeing his arm.
With that, Yumichika grabs his sword and cuts through the remaining the vines.

Regarding the above mentioned race to the bottom, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is urging Europe to roll out a bailout.
The European bailout would look much like the US QE3.
The European Central bank is being urged to aggressively begin buying bonds to lower the borrowing costs of the respective nation.
Such measures will pump more euros into the marketplace and most likely will continue to depress the valuation of the euro.
IMF's Lagarde is also requesting that Greece be given more time to get their financial house in order.

Most of us do not realize that this fashion treadmill - the one that constantly keeps us focused on our next purchase - is actually an invention of the American economic system.
It's hard to break free from the spinning treadmill for sure, but if you truly want to adopt a lifestyle that takes sustainability seriously, you'll need to hear the shocking truth about the true cost of the clothing industry and the economic system that keeps you running from one trend to another.
We may be enjoying reduced pesticide and herbicide use and increased yields as a result of GMO crops right now but at what cost?
What cost to our health and the environment?
Furthermore, as super bugs and super weeds continue increasing their numbers, we will likely see a jump in pesticide / herbicide use as farmers battle this new onslaught as well as a subsequent drop in yields.
So the question should not be - where is it made?
The question should be - is it organic and fair trade?

With the way the Lakers are playing, losing six of their past nine, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing for the Spurs.

When I read a fitness book once, they said, do whatever combination you want, but if you just want immediate results, go running!
Eastern philosophy often considers a physical illness to be a manifestation of an emotional or spiritual inner conflict that has festered.
Meditation is a way to address these conflicts, thus limiting or healing the physical damage.
Skeptical?
No problem.
You don't have to believe anything about a mind-body-spirit connection.
Just act as a scientist.
Try meditating and see how you feel.
Now, I hope you can see that Inner Peace is always within grasp.
And for each of us, maintaining it is our individual responsibility.
I quit my job as an engineer.
As I tossed aside that job title, my finances also crashed.
I went from being a homeowner and landlord, to a debtor with no place to call home.
I had been one that helped the kids financially, picked up the tab at dinner, or bought the unexpected gift.
Suddenly, I was unable to do any of that.
I was staying for weeks or months in the spare bedroom or on the extra couch.

When people see what Judge Walker saw--and they can see for themselves the evidence we put on, and how little the proponents had to offer in defense of Proposition 8--more and more of them will agree that the Constitution does not permit this kind of discrimination."

What better way to start my first blog post than to let you know I am very interested in what the public has to say.
My top priorities include improving TSA's counterterrorism focus through intelligence and cutting edge technology, supporting the workforce, and strengthening our relationships with stakeholders and the traveling public.
I've seen firsthand that strong counterterrorism efforts include an engaged and informed public and it's imperative that we listen.
It's probably too late for this ... but might I suggest that "Talk with TSA" might be a better name for this program than "Talk to TSA"?Plenty of folks here at the blog have been talking to TSA for years now.
Unfortunately, the general feeling here is that TSA doesn't respond.
We don't merely want to talk to TSA; we want to know that TSA will respond substantively.

The President came into tonight's election a damaged political figure with victory far from certain.
He won with help of a unmatched grass-roots campaign and his direct appeal to a broad cross-section of America's ever-changing demographics.
He won't enter his second-term in office with the same momentum in his sails but that's not to say his challenges are any less daunting.

Toontastic is a constructionist learning tool that empowers kids to create their own cartoons while introducing and guiding key storytelling concepts along the way.
Many Constructionist learning tools like Scratch and Logo enable kids to express themselves through computer programming.
We like to think of Toontastic as Scratch for storytelling - swapping out formal logic for story structure (Characters, Setting, Story Events, and Narrative Arc) - the "code" of storytelling.

Although there are other reasons for not celebrating Halloween, I am continually bothered by the reasoning that because Halloween has an ancient religious background (one that many Christians might and do find disturbing) it should not be seen today as a secular holiday.
Regarding Halloween, some non-participating Jews will still hand out candy to children who arrive at their doorstep, for the purpose of darchei shalom , peaceful interaction with non-Jewish neighbors.

It's hard to know what to make of Sarah Palin's rambling, incoherent, utterly illogical resignation speech a few hours ago.
It's probably fruitless to try to deconstruct it because it really made no sense.
Obviously, she was holding something back - like what she's really going to do and what really triggered her resignation - and it was an insult to the people of Alaska and the rest of the United States to play cute and not come clean right away.

Fish grew up at the end of New York's JFK International Airport's Runway 4R/22L, which probably explains his enjoyment of watching planes, fly overhead.
When not shooting photos or traveling Fish designs camera bags, hones is expertise on airline security and spends his time at home cheering for the Red Sox with his 3 kids 102 yards from the ocean.

Jabba-wocky, I've tried several times to make a similar point regarding Force attunement.
From an OT-based perspective, for all we know the genetic component could simply relate to heritable personality traits, the presence of which would make one a "better" Jedi.
Good luck trying to convince others of this.

Our community has not been swept since the storm for 100% sure.
There is so many nails and broken glass that my rental car got a flat tire.
I think the town needs to go to the state and the fed's and make up their budget there.
I, for one, do not believe I should pay the same taxes on an unlivable home as I did on a totally 100% home...it is common sense and PS in the meantime I'm paying rent on an apartment that I'm not even sure the insurance co. will end up coving any part of.
That's my proof that my home is not as "valuable" as it was three weeks ago before the storm!

Knowing my own weaknesses, I thought it a good idea to join a non Oriental site, in my own case Monachos.
I knew I ran the risk of tunnel-vision, of seeing in the BOC what I wanted to see.
The eirenic approach of Abba Seraphim and of Peter were excellent guards against that, and one of the first things that struck me was that they were not trying to 'convert' me; they were just there, unselfishly, to help me as a fellow-Christian looking for a way forward.

Hey Miriam I am not a republican, but a libertarian and their seemed to be economic confusion in this article.
Particularly with the minimumwage I will give an example to explain why it is bad for the poor and young workers.
Let's say a restaurant has 100 dollars per hour to hire low or no skill employees so 20 are hired at 5 dollars an hour.
Now the all-knowing government comes in and says you must pay your employees 10 dollars an hour.
Well the business still only has 100 dollars so they fire ten employees.
Now you have 10 overpaid low skill employees and 10 unemployed workers.- this is why my poor grandparents became republican

I was wondering your thoughts on Care Package being at a 5 kill streak in BO.
I think they should have kept tradition and used an Airstrike, but a Care Package at 5 kills?
It almost CERTAINLY would have been 4 if Airstrikes were at 5, both are much more suitable. ~Yellow~ Add me on Xbox-YellowRiolu 19:09, September 21, 2010 (UTC)

I ask Helene where her staff of wigmakers works.
She points toward the kitchen and says, "Go ahead and look behind that door."
There I find a cramped, fluorescent-lit room where four Quechua women sit around a folding table laden with thick, chestnut-colored ponytails, each weaving strands into a canvas wig block.
They giggle nervously as I examine their handiwork.
"I don't know who wears them," one says, "but I think they're important people."
When I return to the dining room, Helene and the children are braiding the last of the challah.
"I make them pancakes every morning," Helene says, nodding toward the workshop with pride.
"They love pancakes."

Let me turn this around and ask you, Perinatal Loss Nurse, given the kinds of things that "ethisists" are currently consdiering/recommending as ethical AND given the history of hospice care for the aged and ill adult population which has been turned in exactly that direction - i.e. into facilitating termination as opposed to merely caring for the dying and assisting the family - why are you NOT certain that this corruption of the aims of perinatal hospice will occur?

It's possible to walk around the city although many will find the distances between some attractions too large to make walking an option.
Ask the concierge at your hotel to write out the name of your destination (s), as well as how to get back.

Seeking arguments against Christianity may be helpful to know what types of questions one might be asked.
But if you are honestly seeking Truth, you need not worry about your faith, as Christians we believe that Jesus is Truth (He has said that He is the Way, the Truth and the Life).
I would like to finish with another quote from Karl Barth,
Proverbs advises to "seek wisdom."
Knowledge as Wisdom is not "of the Devil."
But it does suggest a practicality or a direction to that knowledge, in developing us as a mature disciple.

Did anyone else notice in the Tennessean where Ben H Garrett, age 99, had died?
Mr Garrett took over management of the Paramount from Charles Amos in the mid-to-late 1940s.
Russ McCown told me probably fifteen or more years ago that he was then working as night watchman at the L&C Tower.

First of all, I would like to thank all who have commented on this blog and encourage more to do so.
This is exactly why I wanted to start Classics Reloaded.
It is easy enough to sit around by yourself, coming up with ideas, tossing them around your own head, with no one to challenge or support you, then moving on.
I was hoping that this would be a place for me to do more than that.
This will be for me a testing ground of sorts for different ideas, theories, etc. that I may come across.
Ideally, I want this to be a conversation.
I am just starting off in the field of classics.
I know I have a lot to learn.
It is my hope that this blog will be a place for me to share my thoughts and receive criticisms and encouragement from you, the readers.That being said, the most recent comments on my last two posts, both on democracy in Athens, have really got me thinking.
As I read them over, I realized that I do indeed need to take a closer, more critical look at my own thoughts on this topic.
I believe that I may have been too hasty in my judgments of Athenian democracy.
I think that I may have come out too strongly in my posts against the Athenians, sounding as though I was certain of the undemocratic nature of Athens rather than accurately conveying the state that I was in - one of questioning and doubt.
I believe that the events that I discussed were intriguing occurrences in a democracy and warrant a closer look.
I do not, however, claim to have the answers.Looking more closely at my issues with the cases of Alcibiades and Nicias, I realize now that it is not the democracticness, as you might say, of Athens that I should be questioning, but rather, perhaps, the fairness, or justness of the system.
(I am still searching for the correct word here, for neither of these are quite accurate.)
The problem may not be that Athens was not democratic enough, but rather quite the opposite, that it was too democratic.
With the citizens having the right and expectation to vote on quite literally everything, there were no checks on the swings of public opinion.
If there was a particularly persuasive orator speaking against Alcibiades, he would be put to death.
Is this wrong?
Not technically.
If that is what the people want, then, in a pure democracy, that must be what happens.
Morally, however, it is easy, hopefully obvious, to take issue with this possibility.
This very well may be a flaw in the system.
One that was remedied with modern democracies, beginning with America.
This is precisely why today we have a republic, not a true democracy.
The legislature and judiciary, in essence, are in place to protect us from ourselves.
I believe the necessity for this protection can, at times, be seen in ancient Athens.Again, this is a topic that requires far, far more discussion than what has already taken place.
I hope that anyone who has anything to contribute will post a comment.
As you can see, I may at times, be a little too hasty to post my thoughts on here.
That's when I hope you will call me out on it.
The comments here have forced me to reconsider my opinions, to take a closer look at stories I already thought I understood and find a more convincing argument.
Hopefully with more time and research, I will yet again fine-tune my opinion on this and other topics.
We shall see...

It is pretty clear that the game does not cheat.

Insurance Corporations are not part of the government.
They are corporations, and if they wish to operate in the United States then they may be compelled to accept citizens with pre-existing conditions.
It is not a concern of the United States, whether an insurance corporation has a large profit or not.
The individual mandate forces citizens to pay corporations under threat of law.
That is wrong. - jhande

i just IMed sloane asking her if i was uncool for listening to and loving liz phair's self-titled, obviously selling-out to radio album. i am going to say no, but we'll wait for her judgment.today. sigh. i couldn't sleep last night. i was so worried about helen, and what she wasn't telling me about her stroke, etc. i cried for a while, and stared blankly at the ceiling, and screamed out silently about how unfair this is. i thought i would be a zombie at work today, but i was a fast-moving hipster zombie, and i saw some old friends, and made some new ones, i think. i ate bagels during my breaks.right after work, lolo and i went to the hospital to see momma hell. i have this thing about hospitals. i hate them. i remember going to see grandma in that hospital in pennsylvania, and how the whole building smelled so clean it was dirty. the woman in the room with helen was as gone as grandma was the last time i saw her, in that same-colored room. i remember the night that lauren and brian and i spent in the waiting room in fredericksburg, watching ER, of all shows, and not knowing what was going to happen to brett, or what had happened to brett. it was terrible, and too much, and i never was able to be as close to them again after that. but then i remember seeing grandfather, and hearing his strong voice even in his whispers.anyway, i realized very soon after we got there that this wouldn't be the last time i saw helen, that she is going to be fine. after grandma's stroke, she didn't remember me, i don't think. helen knew me just as well as always, and made me blush, and told her sister and her daughter-in-law that i am 'easy and free,' whatever that means. i love helen so fully and so honestly and selfishly, and it makes me happy to do so, and i like to think that i have absorbed even one percent of her spirit into my life. i have a feather in my car that she gave me once--she told me i am a warrior. oh, helen, you are the warrior.i had dinner with j and the twins, at maartens, for like 4 hours. it was hilarious. we complained about the new robots that work at starbucks, and talked about counting out marshmallows in cereal, and quarries, and i don't know what else--kidney stones, nights in jails, lousy waittresses. it was phenomenal. launa asked j if she could get a dog--and so, at every possible moment, i would ask j for a dog, a small chihuahua that could live in my shirt pocket. that would be so sweet.also, j promised to get napoleon dynamite to come visit for my birthday party, and to make him dance.and so, i am going to let the night expire, picking out notes on my recently-strung guitar, and let the couch hold me like a lazy lover, and remember how grateful i am for those people that have come into my life over these 23 years and change, and to be even more grateful for the impact that they will have in the future.

This gourmet specialty is a flavorful blend of tender teriyaki glazed chicken strips and our own fat-free sweet onion sauce.
Served hot and toasted on freshly baked bread.
A taste so big, you won't believe it has less than 6g of fat!
Fluffy egg whites, Black Forest ham, salami and spicy pepperoni come together with bubbly melted cheese for a morning masterpiece worthy of the breakfast hall of fame.
Try it today on a hot toasted light wheat English muffin with all your favorite crisp veggies.

Instead, it seems that virtually all living forms can "switch gears," actually switch genes, in times of food shortage.
They can direct energy away from reproduction and toward mechanisms that will allow them to "hunker down" for the long haul and wait to reproduce at a future, more nutritionally opportune time.
In a process called glycation, glucose reacts with protein, resulting in sticky, sugar-damaged proteins called advanced glycated end products (AGEs).
When protein is damaged, it cannot function properly or communicate properly with other cells.
AGEs also promote inflammation and free radical oxidation throughout the body.
AGEs cause skin to wrinkle, and wrinkling and damage to the lining of arteries contributes to plaque and heart attacks.
It can promote the formation of cataracts, macular degeneration, and eventual blindness.

I really didn't know what I wanted to do for a career once I got out of high school.
My dad was an electrical engineer for at least... probably, a quarter short of having a degree.
He got out during the Depression, and so, he had to help support his mom and four siblings, and got out a little early and read meters initially.
But, anyway, they very much wanted me to go to college, and I was oriented that way, and had pretty good grades.
Started out in electrical engineering -- because that's what he was.
Was in that for about four quarters; business for a couple of quarters; and finally decided that fish and wildlife was what I really desired, and what I'd like to do for my life's work.
That was at Iowa State.
Got a bachelors degree there in 1960; masters degree in 1961 -- with a minor in statistics and immature insects.
JG -- Well, were you... what grade were you hired in at?
BM - Yeah.
I knew it was... appropriately, you know, with the reduced annuity, but... it happened, and I've never looked back, and I've been very, very happy that I did it.
The only thing I really missed was the people I worked with, within the Service primarily.
Anyway, it was a good move.
The neglect of poultry that scavenge around the rural farmhouses and in village yards is understandable.
The birds are scattered across the countryside where extension programs are difficult to implement.
Their presence is often so ingrained in traditional village life that they are taken for granted and ignored by the authorities.

Transaction Control Statements
Whether all requested data is available at a node, or whether other nodes need to be referenced to complete the transaction
In Figure 31-2, an application at the sales node initiates a distributed transaction that accesses data from the warehouse and finance nodes.
Therefore, sales.acme.com has the role of client node, and warehouse and finance are both database servers.
In this example, sales is a database server and a client because the application also modifies data in the sales database.
Figure 31-4 Commit Point Strengths and Determination of the Commit Point Site
Oracle ensures the integrity of data in a distributed transaction using the two-phase commit mechanism.
In the prepare phase, the initiating node in the transaction asks the other participating nodes to promise to commit or roll back the transaction.
During the commit phase, the initiating node asks all participating nodes to commit the transaction.
If this outcome is not possible, then all nodes are asked to roll back.
Prepared Response
The node saves redo records corresponding to changes made by the transaction to its online redo log.

Here's some background information you need to remember when you start hearing about the "fight over the debt ceiling" in the coming months.
Raising the debt ceiling does NOT authorize the President to spend more.
It authorizes the President, specifically through the Treasury Department, to pay the bills on debt that CONGRESS PREVIOUSLY AND CONSCIOUSLY decided to incur.
Here's a simple metaphor.
You work for a company with a board of directors.
The company needs to buy some new property and buildings.
The Board itself sets the limits on how much they can spend.
The Board then proceeds to spend more than they were authorized.
The Board now has to raise the limit on what they can spend to pay for the extra amount.
But the Board is trying to blame the office secretary that pays the bills and accusing him/her of asking for unlimited spending power.
If the Board refuses to raise the limit, does not pay those bills, the company's credit will be destroyed.
This company is crucial to their industry and if it collapses so will those related companies.
Similarly, the President is trying to pay the bills.
The US is the largest issuer of currency-money and credit.
So the entire world economy depends on us and our good credit status.
If we default on paying our debts, our credit goes bad.
If our credit goes bad a serious of dominoes will fall and affect the world economy, very, very badly.
Do you see how crazy it is to play politics with such a serious issue?
Do you see how the Republicans are jeopardizing us and even the entire world by doing so?
It's madness.
If you see any Poll Observers violating these rules, get a picture or a video of it if you can (again, be very careful with this).
Try to find out who they are supposed to represent and try to view their credentials.
Notify a Police Officer and/or a Poll Volunteer.
If Federal Observers are there, even better, tell them.
Make note of the time and the names and parties who they represent and as soon as you leave the polling station call the Maricopa County Elections Director Karen Osbourne (602) 506-7960 to report it as well.
And finally, come here, and tell me!

Pelle Neroth -- EU correspondent Edited: 14 March 2013 at 09:52 AM by Pelle Neroth
In this typical Brussels spat, green lobby groups are insisting the UK stand its ground and argue that, of course, double glazing your home could be regarded as a social policy since low income groups are less likely to have this installed.
In an interesting development, the European Commissioner for tax issues, Algirdas Semeta, has promised to have another look at the possibility of lowered interest rates later this year, So does that mean he really is in fact okay with lower VAT on ecological building materials after all - provided the Commission and not the British Government is the body that comes up with the idea?
A matter of prestige. -------------------------
A few weeks ago, in December 2012, the Dutch authorities published an extremely detailed report on Stapel's activities, which had outed the year before.
At an early stage in his career he was appointed a fellow of the Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences and collected large funds from the Dutch science foundation NWO.
They found that in at least 55 publications the data were fully or partly fabricated and that this went back to at least 1998.
The report called Stapel a narcissist and schemer.
As if to live up that description, Stapel wrote book about his own cause and was, the week the report came out a few weeks ago, busily promoting it by giving signing talks at an academic chain of bookshops in the Netherlands.
The Dutch report was very self critical.
It said there was a lot wrong with Dutch research culture.
On cue, the Erasmus university of Rotterdam said it had its very own case of fraud looming, with six hundred papers of one suspect scholar being given the read through again.
Yet the Netherlands has one of the best science traditions, and some of best universities, in Europe.
It's a problem elsewhere in Europe too, of that I have no doubt. -------------------------

As a result, many NGOs blame Luzhkov and his government for "the current destruction of much of the history of Moscow" as well as "bulldozing Moscow's architectural heritage and replacing it with mock-palaces" (The Guardian) including the construction of Catherine II's unbuilt palace in Tsaritsyno and the reconstruction of the Kolomenskoye Palace of Tsar Alexis (demolished as early as the 18th century).[citation needed]

- Anthony Burgess, British writer In the Endeavour Languages translation department, we speak many languages.
When you commission a translation project with us, whether it is a short text, a magazine, a corporate brochure, a website or a series of technical manuals, the document will always be translated by a native speaker in the target language who is an expert in his or her chosen field.
What's more, all our translators are bilingual and bicultural - they understand the nuances of each language and know that it can't be translated literally.
Unlike many competitors, our translations aren't churned out using translation software.
Our translations go through a quality assurance process to ensure that your message is accurate and resonates with your target audience in their everyday language.
If you have a translation project, send it to us.
Based upon the number of words and the language pairs, we will provide you with an exact cost and timeframe for completing the work.
And, we do it all at affordable rates.

With temperatures reaching upwards of 40 degrees in the Tuscany hills of Castiglion Fiorentino, KTM Enduro Factory riders claimed victory in all classes.
In Enduro 3, Britain's David Knight secured his first win of 2012.
Switching to a KTM 300 EXC for the GP of Italy, Knight immediately placed at the sharp end of the results by setting the fastest time in the Friday evening super test.
Maintaining his advantage throughout day one, he held on to claim a well-deserved win.
On day two he recovered solidly from a small crash in the morning to place third.

I think everybody got closer."
Oliver: "As a kid, you hear all these stories about Flight 93 and the firefighters in New York going into the building to save people by risking their lives.
There were so many acts of heroism, and that's something you really look up to as a kid.
You can see that as a way that you want to live your life.
That's the way you want to be regarded as by other people."
Brown: "I think it made a lot of people our age wake up to the reality of the world.
It made people realize that everything is not OK, that we are going to go through turmoil at certain parts of our lives and that all you can do is try get through it together.

We are all patients of the medical profession at some time in our lives - I have been very lucky not to have needed the services of doctors and hospitals very much in my life, but I have had one of the potentially fatal diseases that some homeopaths claim to be able to cure.
Some of my family, on the other hand, have received the full benefit of scientific medicine.
As a taxpayer, I would like to see my money used in the NHS to best advantage - that means for effective treatment.
(I have no problem with patients paying for homeopathy, snakes" entrails or reiki if they choose).
And I would be very concerned if I , or someone I knew, was referred to someone who holds the sort of views expressed by Dr Lewith and his colleagues.
Not necessarily because they may consider homeopathy useful or even possibly effective, but because they are educated and accomplished doctors and yet they argue for their vested interest in this inept way.
Perhaps homeopaths will object to this on the ground that it would be unethical to administer a strong remedy to someone who is not sick, but I'm a willing volunteer, and will endure great danger in the cause of science...
In contrast, for a legitimate technique like MRI there is no end of explanation available to show how the use of the technique depends on the real quantum effect involved.

There is this bold design made with blue rope in a gold and black motif from the Albrecht.
For these, all you do is arrange the rubber band formation the way you want and pierce it with a large sewing needle through all layers.
Then take a piece of jewelry wire and thread it through the holes.
All these above could be strung on a chain or cord to create a necklace.
To make your own, all you need is mod podge, needle, metallic gold thread, scissors, two sequins, two beads, and a couple of earring hooks.

Unfortunately, Pacifica management seems to have taken a very different course.
The arrest of protesters at the station, the installation of armed guards at the station and the imposition of strict regulations on guests at the station have done nothing to ease the tension or cool tempers in this dispute.
In fact, the actions take by Pacifica have produced just the opposite, inciting further protest from listeners as well as KPFA staff.
A network founded 50 years ago by renowned pacifist Lew Hill is certainly no place for such tactics.

HEADSHOTS My Philosophy on Shooting Headshots based on what Casting Directors, Agents and Other Industry Professionals want: The photo has to be YOU, meaning: a) When you walk into the room you look EXACTLY THE SAME.
They should not wonder if it is you or have to imagine that, "Oh, it's you but all dolled up."
(Yes, people still say "dolled up!") b) We should clearly see your SPECIFIC TYPE/LOOK/GENRE for the type of jobs you are trying to book (ex: If you are going for the "Girl Next Door" rolls, don't show up with heavy eye make-up and wear spandex and then refuse to smile for your shots).c) NOTHING OTHER THAN YOU!!
The background and any accessories should not distract from your moneymaker (your face, duh).
When professionals look at your headshot we want their eyes to go straight to your eyes and to know exactly what you are selling.
We DON'T want them to be distracted by a busy background or gaudy accessories.
HERE'S MY GUARANTEE: You ONLY PAY if you find a shot you are HAPPY WITH!!
Otherwise, IT'S ON ME!!!

Hollywood can go soft when you least expect it.I think it's too simplistic to reduce the race to Marty v. Clint at this point.
Nobody is in Clint's films, and Marty's film is, well, been there done that (and much better).Besides, both of their films are heavy, bloody.You get my drift.

Police need to speak short verbal english commands and not military commands.
Do you honestly think that the average citizen understands what "stand down" means?
Ask the average person in Wal-Mart what "stand down" means and you will get a different answer every time.
Ask them the definition of "stop" and they will know as in stop light.

We'll never post anything without your permission.
I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to respond to these comments and questions!
I have been out of the country and just reviewed my recipes on Food52 now!
I will fix the ingredient list now, a little confusing I'd agree.
Apple Annie, Thank you so much for featuring the recipe as an editors pick! almost 3 years ago

Oh, my goodness!
If you have ever eaten roasted broccoli, you may never like it fixed any other way again!
Preparing broccoli in this way is so easy even a child can do it!
Here's how:
Put the whole business into a good sized bowl.
Drizzle the juice of a lemon over the broccoli and zest that lemon, scattering the zest over it.
Toss everything gently and add 1/3 of a cup or so of Parmesan cheese to top it off before taking it to the table.
Just for fun, put just a PINCH of nutmeg over your dish...it might make people inquire, "What IS that deliciousness on my broccoli?" grin
Allow this to stand for about 10-15 minutes before serving so as to allow the flavors to marry.

This is who I am, who I want to be.
I don't have to hide my true self, or be judged for what I enjoy doing.
I like coming here, and the people make me feel plenty welcome.
So I think I'll stay a while. c:

Maya smiled down at him as his head moved, nodding to her words as he agreed.
She could feel his fingers gripping firmly to her ass, moving her against him even more as his cock continued to brush against her wetness, her thighs trembling slightly as she bit her lip, his words causing her to arch a brow curiously before in the blink of an eye, she felt his hands pulling her hips forward in a quick sharp movement, burying his member deep inside of her fiery depths as a loud gasp left her lips, followed by a loud whimper of pleasure as her head tilted up toward the ceiling, his words causing a soft laugh to leave her lips as she let out a loud breath.

Well, Kristen was never one of my top suspects to be the Mole.
She looked more like a player to me.
So I was right about her.I think Craig's the Mole, although it could also be either Nicole or Clay.
I think Paul's just a jerk, although he too could be the Mole.

I have my first half marathon this Saturday.
I started training in March for a half in July, but the half was cut down to a 5 mile since it was too hot.
So I feel like I've been training forever!
I'm excited but nervous about how to handle pacing.
I know everyone is different, but what's your preference?
Consistent?

this issue should also exist in CS5 although I didn't check it with CS5.
If your extension is a CSXS extension (no *.mxi file in package), you can use the workaround provided by David in third reply to install the extension manually.
Note that you have to change the folder name "com.pixelnovel.timeline" in that post to the ExtensionBundleId of your extension (in manifest.mxl).
I don't suppose it is a lot of help, but the problem here is that InDesign does not know what a pixel is.
Yes, yes, it says that it does and it offers pixels as a unit, but it is a bald-faced lie.Internally, when you say "pixel," InDesign treats that as 1/72 of an inch, or 1 point.And later, when you export to something where pixels are the units, it converts points to pixels.
As a result, it has no idea how many physical screen pixels should really be displayed for every "pixel."
This is, of course, a legacy of the InDesign's history.
It was designed for print work, where no one would design to a pixel, and in fact, where if you are trying to design at the pixel level, you are almost certainly doing something wrong.
This new feature, in CS6, of 100% View being actual size, was viewed as a boon to CS6 users.
And indeed, for many of us, it is.
But unfortunately, it does change the question of whether there is a 1-point-in-your-document to 1-pixel-on-your-screen relationship.
It's fairly difficult to have both.
I'm sure in the future, InDesign's treatment of pixels will improve, and it will grow a real understanding of them.
It seems inevitable in the digital publishing world, but a lot of ID's internals would have to change.
But fortunately enough, you can turn back display to 72ppi, and restore the legacy behavior.
There may be cleverer solutions, as well.

"I'd say PS3 was a challenge to work on," he said, "but every new platform takes a while to get used to.
Put it like this, I worked on early PS2 games, and those were a real nightmare - we're getting code up and running on PS3 much faster than we did last time around."
The interesting ALU performance numbers are 51 billion dot products per second (total system performance), 300M transistors, and more than twice as powerful as the 6800 Ultra.
a) it's a Sony, and those that have bought PSP's or other Sony products the last couple of years do have the right IMO, to feel a bit cheated.
I just put that custom FW by Dark_Alex on my PSP and am never going back to another Sony FW.
Making people buy a PS3 in order to play PS games on the PS...screw that.
Whether the PS3's inability to shift games has turned into a problem for Sony.

Fin choice also depends on the board Yopu use as the width of the tail of Your board also affects the performance of the fin so for example a fin that is good for one board for 80kg sailor can not be good with another board for the same sailor.
I set my boom at the height of my forehead.
When in harness lines and fully straped the boom will be in comfortable position (on the height of arms).
It is the width of the board that makes the boom feel higher than it should be when not planning however when planning and fully straped and hooked it feels right.
Some people say that when it gets windy You should lower Your boom but experience shows that it's usefull only in really and i mean REALLY overpowered condistions (when having serious troubles wuth holding on to a set while sailing).
Generally for 99% of conditions it's good to be on the height of Your forehead.

Markstrom, Bernier scares me a bit when he has played he has always been very underwhelming but maybe its becasue he never gets in a grove.
To me Schnieder is the best comparison and even though Schnieder rotted behind Luongo for years when he played he was always incredible.
Bernier's handful of NHL starts have not been impressive.
I think Markstrom is overrated but I still like his unknown potential over what Bernier has shown.

Ending the 26" HD would be a huge mistake on Ibis's part.
I doubt they would go that far.
I know I wouldn't have bought mine if it was not a 26" bike.
Giving options to those that want other wheel sizes is good, but don't mess with a good thing.
Ibis should really make a 650b specific bike and leave the HD as a 26" bike.
I have tried all the wheel sizes and by far like 26" best.
I am no where near the rider that Brain lopes is, but I agree with him on his recent tweet about 26" wheels.

The Watchoutski Brothers didn't really direct V for Vendetta.
Also, I think a director's track record speaks more than a specific gem in their filmography.
I'd be a lot more worried about Superman if it was being directed by George Lucas or M. Night Shyamalan for example, and we know what they were responsible for in their prime.

I still lose picks too often but since I started keeping them all in one spot, they tend to stick around longer.
I can't stand those thin picks anymore though, they used to be all I used but now I'm not comfortable with anything below 1mm.

Most of the studies done have been "inconclusive."
The studies done for Grand Theft Childhood were some of the better conducted ones, but they still only covered a small base of applicants.
There is certainly more which can be done- though these upcoming studies, so long as they are performed by non-governmental organizations with neutral bias and zero industry tampering, will probably just back up the studies proclaiming "reactions to violent games are a reflection of other issues in a person's life; they are not a catalyst, as has been proposed by scapegoaters."

DX11 - Weird shader behavior with and without branching
Very interesting.
A lot of pelope think that David Chase was doing the same thing with the Sopranos, especially toward the end.
Chase wanted to force the viewers to confront their fascination with the violence and evil of the Sopranos universe wanted to condemn the audience for loving the show.I actually had moral issues playing Colonization.
Although there are four European powers, I only found two strategies that really worked.
One was to play as the English, French, or (preferably) Dutch, and essentially industrialize/explore/trade.
The other was to play as the Spanish and annihilate the natives for gold.
I was never able to bring myself to pursue the Spanish strategy for very long, and in fact, I often went out of my way to stop the Spanish (by giving guns to the natives, picking fights with the Spanish, etc.).But then, the natives were really annoying, so sometimes I essentially used the Spanish to do my dirty work.
The Spanish would slaughter the natives, and then I would conquer the Spanish.
The end result was nice, open land with no pesky natives to attack my wagon trains.
I didn't do anything to make the Spanish slaughter the natives, but I let them do it and didn't attack them until they had cleared a large swathe of territory.Sounds worse and worse the more I think about it.

Apart from that, it's a pretty good review.

I wrote about finding the perfect granola bar recipe over a year ago and since then I have tested and tried many, many, different variations.
Some were pretty great, others not so much.
The bars I'm sharing today are very similar, but use mashed banana in place of the honey, which makes them sugar free, unless of coarse you add in the chocolate chips.
Wow, fantastic recipe!
I used 1/8 cup of flax seed in lieu of other seeds, dried cherries, walnuts, crunchy peanut butter, unsweetened flaked coconut and chopped up dark chocolate.
The batter is delicious and it just went into the oven.
Perfect timing for a long weekend of backpacking - thank you!

We are in a war: Those of us engaged with the subject of climate change are combatants, willing or not.
We are obliged to take sides, for this is a highly polarised conflict, conflating any number of issues - political, social, material, spiritual, economic, environmental etc. - and so high do the stakes appear to be, it is hardly surprising that any number of methods, some plainly dishonest, are being deployed in order to "win" the argument (as if the sounder ideology will, in some way, bring influence to bear on what science discovers, or how the climate reacts).
The moral dilemma is clear enough, despite the atavistic notion of chivalry at its heart.
There is, however, a key question embedded in the story: can you beat the other side without using methods you believe to be despicable, immoral or inhumane?
Can you defeat a gun-wielding opponent with a bow and arrow?
Can lies and propaganda be defeated by the truth?

Ah, the Arcanite.
This is the badass of the bunch.
You want to play a warrior that flings around blasts of raw arcane energy?
Everyone does, or surprisingly, only one player at a time really gets into it.
I mean, if we had a full group of these guys my campaign world would probably look like swiss cheese.
These guys have all the flash and power that you would expect from a fighter who channels raw energy instead of learning the intricacies of the craft.
Of course, it's all fun and games until they crit-fail themselves (or a party member) in the face.
I mean, it's still fun for me at least.

Although the "members only" idea was deemed not sustainable after a few years, many new ideas were carried forward from this time of change as leadership passed to a new generation.
This shift in direction marked the end of founding member Adele Nichol's many years of service as volunteer artistic or gallery director- a role she had filled since the 1970s.
Nichols continued to participate and support the organization until her death in 2000.
Long time treasurer and founding member Madge Ames had resigned her office two years earlier, after 30 years of volunteer service, in various capacities, including gallery director in the 1960s.

Omaha, Nebraska!
The interview went really well in my opinion.
When they contacted me last week to set up the phone interview, they told me I was one of four out of 250 applicants that they will be interviewing.
It was flattering to know that I was picked out of such a huge pool of applicants to move forward.
Prior to hearing from them last week, I'd never really thought about Omaha.
To be honest, I don't know what to think of that city, but I've never been there before so I'm trying to keep an open mind through the rest of this application/interview process.
The gentlemen I interviewed with told me that they have a hard time getting people to commit to moving to Omaha.
I can understand that.
I'm sure the city has a lot to offer and if I get selected to do an in-person interview, I'll investigate it more, but as of right now, the only thing I know about Omaha is that ConAgra Foods is headquartered there.
That, and Counting Crows, my favorite band, has a song titled "Omaha."

Ah, I just link-chased to your comment at "Editorial Anonymous," and see that your did indeed talk to the police, fruitlessly.
Are you a writer with a book to talk about?
Or a publishing professional who is tired of explaining what you really do at work?
If so, I want to hear from you.If you've had a book or two published, then I'd love it if you'd share your experiences here.
Anyone is welcome to contribute a book review; and if there's a publishing issue you'd like to write about here then please let me know (my email address is "HPRW at tesco dot net").
If you can add to my lists of writers' resources I'd be very grateful; and if you have any questions that you think I might be able to answer, give me a shout and I'll do my best to respond.

May 16: The display's at it again!
At this point I'm pissed, because I'm worried Apple's going to try blaming the out-of-warranty display, which is a lousy scapegoat given that this display works great with any pre-Thunderbolt Mac.
I furiously schedule another Genius bar appointment.
In the evening, I go to genius bar with my iMac and explain the issue.
After some deliberations with the Geniuses, they decide it's likely not the Mac, but rather the Apple Cinema Display.
They explained that there is a compatibility issue with some of the Apple Cinema Displays manufactured before Apple's Thunderbolt transition.
Genius explained that I should take my iMac back to the office, come back with my display and they'll give me a new one that was manufactured since then.
I come back 30 minutes later with my Cinema Display, the guy I meet with goes in back to get everything situated, and he comes out with the box for a brand spanking new 27″ Apple Cinema Display.
He explained that they don't make 24″ ones anymore so I get a free upgrade.
Since it was a brand new display I asked if I could get AppleCare for it, which I was permitted to do.
Yay!
I walk back to the office with my new 27″ display and haven't had a problem since.

This assist is not intelligent about lists - it just assigns one name to the list and selects this new name so the user can change it if desired.
If this is a highly desired feature, perhaps this choice can be re-evaluated.
added a comment - 10/Apr/12 10:57 PM Here's the quick assist.
A few points: This assist is not intelligent about lists - it just assigns one name to the list and selects this new name so the user can change it if desired.
If this is a highly desired feature, perhaps this choice can be re-evaluated.
This fix makes a reasonable guess of a name based on the statement.
Additionally, this assist is not available for statements that are return statements - either explicitly or implicitly.
In terms of the key-binding, I sunk a few hours into it but I had no luck with it.
Since the end of term is approaching, I wanted to share what I have.
Finally, this fix is dependent on a helper function contained in the patch attached to GRE1346.

As for type-inferencing, linked editing mode and the key-binding, I will address those shortly.

The intention is to have an audience in Melbourne.
Maldonado's clearly there because of the money, but on the other hand, he's shown more flashes of real ability than Nakajima ever did.
Yes, it took him four years to win the GP2 title and he was thrashed by Hulkenberg when they teamed up at ART in "09, but he's always been very quick around Monaco.
And he had a pretty phenomenal winning run mid-season in the feature races this year, against arguably a stronger field than last year.
Suggests he has *some* innate ability.

If he chooses wrongly, he may end up being a Darkland Beast, an enemy of the Knights of White, instead of helping to command them.
Des� immortality is wearing thin and he is close to making that one decision that could make him the Beast he does not want to be.
Jessica Montgomery has managed to become guardian of the Book of Solomon.
Her mother had spent her life looking for the book and after her death Jessica and her father found it and wanted to keep it safe in memory of Jessica�s mother.
To Des, Jessica is becoming a needed desire.
He feels an overwhelming connection to her, a connection he is unsure of, a connection that is starting to take over Des� life.
Beast of Desire is an intriguing and fantastic second book in The Knights of White series.
Des� struggle with himself and his desire for Jessica was well-drawn and appealing.
As characters, Des and Jessica were flawed and yet perfect.
Destiny is used as a thread that keeps the reader believing that maybe, just maybe, there is someone for everyone no matter how mysterious a person is.
If you like paranormal with some suspense, Beast of Desire is a novel you will enjoy and look towards the next novel in the series with anticipation.

After studying in both Germany and Zimbabwe, I moved to South Africa and attended Rhodes University where I majored in Drama and TV Journalism.
I started a theatre company called Makendast in 2001, which was sponsored by the National Arts Council, and put on several productions until the end of 2003.
The stories performed were inspired by the political situation in Zimbabwe as one by one my friends and family lost their farms and homes.
The company also taught theatre workshops at various schools in the Western Cape, including disadvantaged community schools and started a Physical Theatre curriculum at Vus'Abantu in the township of Langa.
Mime and clowning was my forte as I had trained with the legendary Andrew Buckland.

Transcript SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.
I'm Scott Simon.
This week in Egypt, a nation that has been ruled for thousands of years by pharaohs, colonial rulers, military regimes and dictators held its first free election for a national leader.
Egyptians went to the polls on Wednesday and Thursday, and though the official results are not yet in, the election is certainly a milestone in the democratic awakening known as the Arab Spring.
Here's a selection of voices from Cairo in the week that Egypt voted.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: There'll be some ups and downs, I believe.
But it's definitely better than what we've been through for the past 30 years.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: And it's very nice to live for the first time in my age the real democracy.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I think it's wonderful to have finally be able to cast one's votes.
We have a choice.
And I hope that this choice is going to reflect what we need for the time being.
SIMON: Unofficial results indicate that the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Mohamed Morsi, has likely won a spot in the runoff later this month against Ahmed Shafik, a former aide to former President Mubarak.
Now, that would pit the two most divisive contenders against one another for the presidency of Egypt.
We're joined by three of NPR's correspondents in the region.
Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Egypt; Eleanor Beardsley in Tunis; and Kelly McEvers is covering Syria from Beirut.
Thanks for being with us.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you.
KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: You're welcome.
SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Yes, you're welcome.
SIMON: Soraya, let's start with you from Egypt, because the election took place.
A lot of Egyptians and even people around the world would have thought that would be impossible just a couple of years ago.
Help us understand the impact of these elections even taking place.
NELSON: Well, every single TV station, all these new private stations that have popped up since the revolution, have been carrying results.
Everybody says that they're somehow getting this information from counting stations.
It's just amazing and bizarre.
And what's emerged is this intense interest in basically who is going to be the elected leader, I mean, an actual elected leader in this country not someone who's sort of been forced upon people.
And so it's something that really has generated an interest even far beyond the parliamentary elections that have happened here.
SIMON: But, as some historians and others have pointed out, voting could be the easy part.
It's accepting the results that is sometimes the hard part, particularly for those who lose.
What does that look like from there?
NELSON: Well, certainly if the Muslim Brotherhood is correct, I mean, they almost immediately came out and said their candidate, and Ahmed Shafik, who is basically the one who is most closely allied with the ruling generals.
This is the last prime minister here in Egypt.
Now, if these two end up running against each other, there is going to be a lot of conflict and a lot of teeth gnashing.
No one's going to be happy because this is not really what people were envisioning when the revolution took place back in February 2011.
SIMON: Eleanor, you're in Tunis at the moment, where a lot of this got started.
They've already had elections.
They have a democratically elected government.
But did that produce some of the dramatic changes that a lot of people had hoped for?
BEARDSLEY: Well, Scott, like Soraya was saying, the revolution was the joyful, fun part of it, it seems, and afterwards comes the realism, you know.
I would say the bloom is a little bit off the rose here.
Yes, there's been one huge change that everyone agrees upon; people are free to speak, and people are speaking about anything and everywhere.
But, you know, there is disappointment because the economy hasn't changed.
It's still very bad.
Unemployment is high.
And there's a lot of talk about who owns this revolution.
We have a coalition government ruling and the majority party is Islamist.
And so there's huge discussions about what does it mean to be a Muslim.
You know, Tunisian Muslims are traditionally very tolerant and open.
There's this new extremist element - these Salafis that have come in.
You know, what is the role of women?
Traditionally, Tunisian women have been very liberated.
They want to keep that status.
So, you know, I've been speaking to people who say we feel confused and at a loss.
We don't know where we're going.
We need a road map.
SIMON: Kelly McEvers, you're in Beirut, but obviously doing a lot of reporting on the situation in Syria.
Do Syrians wonder what makes them different so far from Egypt, Tunis, even Libya?
MCEVERS: It's really interesting, you know.
Syrians started their uprising not long after, you know, Egypt's uprising came to a head and yet here we are almost 15 months later and the dictator, the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, is still holding onto power.
Many people think he has a pretty firm grip on power.
And you look at these elections in Egypt and Tunis and you look at the rise of the Islamists and in some ways that makes the regime in Syria even stronger.
And it makes a lot of people inside Syria a little bit more weary of what comes next.
Syria also is a place that for some time has been very secular and very moderate, quite a number of different ethnic groups and different religious leanings inside Syria.
And so I think you have, you know, some of the minority groups in particular - Christians and otherwise - who look at this sort of Sunni-Islamist wave in these other countries and say, hmm, maybe that's not something we want.
There's also just sort of the bare facts of the brutality of the crackdown in Syria.
I mean, I think that a lot of Syrians look at that and see that that's quite different.
I mean, more than any of the other uprising countries put together, we have had thousands of people die in Syria, protesters, and yet they still go out to the streets every single day.
They're not going to stop until their dictator falls too.
SIMON: What do you see as the challenges the country you're covering right now is going to be facing over the next year?
Soraya, in Egypt?
NELSON: Well, the big one here is going to be the constitution.
You know, this country has to define itself.
You know, what are the rights going to be for people?
Women's rights, just like in Tunisia, it's a huge debate here right now.
Certainly women are not participating in politics in this post-revolutionary Egypt in the numbers that they did during Mubarak's time.
Granted, they were appointed back then, they had limited power, but now there's nobody here except for a handful, for example, in the parliament.
So, this constitutional debate about, you know, what is Egypt?
How much does it mesh with Islamic law?
You know, what are the rights of minorities here?
You know, how are the politics going to work?
Is the president going to be a powerful one, like has been the case, or is it going to be more of a parliamentary system?
These are questions that the population is going to have to wrangle with for a long time to come.
SIMON: Eleanor Beardsley in Tunis?
MCEVERS: Well, Scott, I think what's at stake here is the soul of Tunisia.
This country is going to not fight it out 'cause they're not really fighters but argue it out and debate it out.
Is it going to be a secular modern state, albeit a Muslim one, or are extremists going to be able to take over?
And a recent poll came out that showed that 42 percent of Tunisians harken back with fond memories to the time of Ben Ali.
So, 42 percent said, you know, it was better then, but they've definitely taken the right path.
They know that.
Everyone is saying this conversation needs to happen but we're Tunisians, we're used to debate.
You know, we'll get it right.
SIMON: Kelly McEvers in Beirut covering Syria.
A year ago, a lot of people would have said that the Assad regime is on its way out.
What do you imagine Syrians are going to be contending with over the next year?
MCEVERS: There's one thing that Syrians are going to be facing in the coming year that almost everyone here in the region agrees, and that is violence.
Syria's crackdown on protesters was by far the most violent of all the Arab uprisings.
We are above 10,000 people killed now.
And I was speaking to an analyst the other day and he said, you know, this is probably a ten-year issue we're looking at in Syria.
President Assad probably doesn't have much longer.
It's likely that he will fall.
Will he fall violently?
Will he fall because of sanctions?
Will he fall because one of his allies, like Russia, talks him into some kind of abdication of power?
Nobody knows the answer to that.
But then once he does, because we've got so much violence, then we'll see a transition period that's very dangerous, this analyst told me.
And after that we'll see a period where Syria's just basically trying to put itself back together, much like its neighbors, Lebanon and Iraq, that has experienced similar sort of sectarian-based violence.
SIMON: Kelly McEvers in Beirut.
Before that, Eleanor Beardsley in Tunisia and Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Egypt.
Thank you all very much.
NELSON: You're welcome.
MCEVERS: You're welcome.
BEARDSLEY: Thank you, Scott.

First of all, I know that He would not have His Body ignorant.
So, as painful as it is, please help us to spread the news of this holocaust that is happening on our watch.
A few years ago, we took our children to visit the Nazi concentration camp of Dachau.
They couldn't believe the stories they read about the Germans claiming to not be aware of the holocaust happening under their noses.
Since then, the world has spent the last six generations pointing our fingers at the Germans.
Yet, here we sit not wanting to know what is happening today - in our generation - for the same reason, it is painful to know - and it calls for our response.
I am asking you to speak out, share this story, and inundate your congressman with your demands for US pressure on both the GOS and China, who funds much of this genocide in exchange for oil.
Christ calls us to participate in His suffering, and nothing grieves Him more than oppression upon widows and orphans.
This is our opportunity to share in the work of the cross as it hammers against the vilest assault known to mankind, gross profit made at the expense of the defenseless.

It is also pleasing to be able to report how busy and exciting this year has been, as the foundations that have been so carefully laid have paved the way for significant business expansion.
It has been a year when the Group has gone from strength to strength; from a strong foundation to a strong operating performance.
Without exception, all the companies in the Group have seen growth.
In some cases the growth has been through new business ventures, as management have identified and seized new opportunities.
In others it has been in serving a steadily growing customer base (across a widening number of countries in our region), as the quality of our services has become increasingly recognised in our markets.
In yet others it has been in acquisitions and mergers, as synergies have become apparent.

Second, I searched online for any stories or mention of bike racks at Dodger Stadium, figuring that if the racks have been there in years past that someone would have used them and written about them.
I found two articles bemoaning the lack of bike options at the stadium.
The more recent article was by David Pulsipher for C.I.C.L.E. and was written last September.
The other article was written in 2004 by Paul Dorn of the California Bike Coalition.

Norbert was our blue-tongue lizard.
We found him underneath the dishwasher several years ago, but didn't want to let him back outside because the dogs would kill him.
So we kept him.
But then there were some incredibly high winds that knocked his cage over and smashed the glass.
He escaped and is now roaming freely.
See you around, Norbert!

Before that Miliband must manage his appearance at the anti-cuts march on Saturday - he has sought to tread a line between aggressive anti-cuts language and sensible opposition.
His team have taken steps to ensure he is not seen to be too close to the fiery union leader Mark Serwotka.
William Hague faced mild embarrassment when he told MPs Libyan military aircraft were unable to take to the air as news emerged that French fighter jets had shot down an aircraft.

This talk investigates the pottery from waster pits associated with Thomas Ball's pottery (c1801-1823) in the Haymarket.
This is the earliest Pottery site investigated so far in Australia.
Thomas Ball was a Staffordshire-trained potter operating a Pottery in the Brickfields (now the Haymarket) and produced a range of locally-made wares, a mixture of utilitarian items and decorated tablewares, as well as smoking pipes and marbles.
The tablewares imitated Staffordshire ceramics while others were decorated with unusual green and brown floral hand painted patterns.
Aspects of the kiln and manufacturing process are discussed.
Thomas Ball's ceramics are also discussed within the context of other pottery imported into the colony at that time.

Virginia, your little friends are wrong.
They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age.
They do not believe except they see.
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds.
All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little.

One would think ensuring the seriously mentally ill get treatment would be the core mission of the Office of Mental Health.
But it hasn't been ever since Michael Hogan was appointed commissioner.
His stated goal is to "create hope filled, humanized environments and relationships in which people can grow" not getting medications to the seriously mentally ill.
One can understand what drives his hospital closure policy - "Hey Gov., look how much money I'm saving!"
But it's harder to understand how Cuomo doesn't recognize the impact on people with serious mental illness, public safety, and how Hogan's efforts to save OMH money are costing the criminal justice system and the state much more.

On the surface, Predator's feature set looks very familiar: three oscillators are pumped through a multimode filter and a handful of modulation sources.
These functions are augmented by an assortment of effects and the now-obligatory arpeggiator.However, you shouldn't be fooled by this apparent simplicity: the devil, as they say, is in the details, and it's only when you start poking the parameters that Predator's powerful punch really becomes apparent.It's easy to forge sounds of real depth and sophistication without getting sidetracked by arcane algorithms and impenetrable parameters.
Needless to say, Predator comes packed with a plethora of presets from Papen himself.Powerful, easy to get into and with awesome sounds, Predator is a no-brainer for dance musicians and a must-try synth for anyone else.READ: Rob Papen Predator reviewNative Instruments Razor

Listen to the GM and follow his rules, everyone should know he is the final word in the RP.
If you do not like certain GMs rules, do not join that RP.
No trash talking about GMs around the forum they have a lot on their hands, be careful how you treat them.
He has the final word on his story, accepting character sheets and mechanics.
Talk with him on something, he will always compromise, I advise GM's not to take authority like steps with this rule, just tell what your bottom line in the RP is.

Joined Mar 2010 From Chicago Posts 2,340 Awards 1 Ah, it wasn't clear to me that you knew how to write the equations but not solve them.
I did not know that the three cases you mentioned were the ones I wrote down.
Please try to be a little more specific in the future, and show work; you would have gotten the guidance you needed a lot sooner that way.
I figured since solving systems of equations is more advanced than cross multiplying that you knew the procedure.
Hopefully with sa-ri-ga-ma's post you will now have what you require to complete the problem.
Best regards.
Edit: Maybe by "factorising" you meant applying the distributive property?
For example if you wanted to solve you would need to distribute as follows Or further on, there is a place to factor out a .
Of course it's much easier to just solve and plug in the value of you find to make sure it satisfies Anyway, this is a complete solution to one of the three cases you mentioned, so now you really should have all the tools you need to solve the other cases.
One can define (Paragraph 1.5, page 10) a fibrant-object structure on a suitable cartesian closed category of topological spaces $\bf Top$, called the $\pi_0$-fibrant structure:
The question is in the title.
The category $\bf pSet$ of partial functions has sets as objects and $\hom (X,Y) $ is the set of all triples $ (X,Y,f) $ such that there exists $D\subseteq X$ and $f\colon D\to Y$.
Composition of arrows is composition of relations .

Further, whereas Mosser envisions the kingdom of God as being brought about by God's unilateral power, Latter-day Saints expect the kingdom of God to be brought about through our love for God.
Only when we truly do the will of God freely will his kingdom reign.
The kingdom is not brought about by coercive power, but by loving persuasion.
The kingdom of God is not found in the sky but inside of us.

It might be more difficult for Republicans to bash President Obama for being "timid" in his comments about the Iranian government's violence against protesters if the U.S. media didn't consistently censor US-Iranian history.
Take CNN's recent Iran timeline, titled "A brief look at Iran's history."According to the timeline, which begins in 1979, Iran has "been at odds with the West and some of its neighbors" since the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

Yet in the mother of all omissions, CNN leaves out how the US government was directly involved in bringing the Shah to power in a 1953 coup that toppled the democratically elected Iranian government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.As a June 4 Agence France-Presse article details:The CIA, with British

House Bill 6004 makes a new state-wide school district, the Education Achievement Authority, which can take over the "bottom 5%" of schools, and perhaps others - while the local district has no say.
The EAA is free to hand these schools over to for-profit charter management companies, and in fact it can charter new schools anywhere in the state (whether the schools there are failing or not).
The EAA would be run by a board appointed by the Governor, and even the elected State Board of Education would have no say in its work.

Her AKC name was Bendywood Sleigh Belle, but we called her Belle.
She was like a lot of dogs - she loved chasing squirrels, eating and playing.
But she was unique as well.
She was stubborn and never learned to fetch because she thought it was much more fun to train us to chase her.
She learned words just by listening to us.
LeCoco, Cindy, dinner, go, Grandma's - she understood what they all meant.
And she adored my father.
He was the only one who was allowed to hold her on her back like a baby, rub her chin and talk baby talk to her.

While putting takes concentration and patience, there are still some ways you can speed up the round and play ready golf.
Try to read the slope while others are putting, and stand near your ball so that when it's your turn you can get to your spot quickly in order to make your putt.

Alicia is a member of the FPDT, which was successful in stopping the construction of an international airport on farmland in Atenco and Texcoco Mexico in 2001.
The community-based organization struggles for the rights of campesinos and for the land they work.
Spanish-language audio interviews with members of the community:
"The recall occurred at a time of public anger over the city's financial crisis and over its business relationship with a company that Nelson Oliva founded and that he said he transferred to two daughters shortly before he became city manager in April 2007; that company, NEO Consulting Inc./Affordable Housing Solutions Group, had $3 million in city contracts over a three-year period, approved by the City Council.
But the pivotal event that triggered the recall drive was the council's firing in December of interim City Manager Charlie Long, who had publicly disclosed the gravity of the financial crisis, and its reinstatement of Oliva from medical leave, if only temporarily.
Oliva resigned in January under an agreement that gave him a year's salary and benefits."

September 15th, 2010 at 4:09 am Ava- I first heard it when I was about 15, when Heather Locklear named her daughter with Richie Sambora, Ava.
I always said I wanted to use this name for my own daughter.
I even fought my sister over it when she was pregnant with my niece.
I'm just sad that it's so very common now.
But I love Seraphina for a girl, always thought it to be beautiful and unique.
My favorite boy's name changed over the years too, but in my top ten are Nicholas, Jonathan (I've thought for years this pair would be great for twin boys), Adam and Scott.
The number-one spot is held by the name Christian.
Not for any religious connotations, but because I really like the sound of the name and it sounds fresher than Christopher (another member of my top ten).
Juliet and Charlotte both are gorgeous imo!

It is really hard for me to respond when so many people are discussing so many different topics as if they were all same thing!Lori keeps talking about growing alpines, which to me is not 'rock gardening' but rather one subset.
She also keeps going back to the topic of weed fabric with a thin gravel mulch.
This topic is completely different than using weed fabric as a barrier to separate the native soil from a specific mix used in a special garden bed.
My original response to Tim was directed at using weed fabric to separate an imported medium from native soil.Regarding using weed fabric under a gravel mulch for true alpines, no I would probably not do this.
Alpines are so tiny that using weed fabric would seem like using a 10 pound sledge to drive a penny nail.
Many are so miniature that I prefer to grow them in pots rather than in the open garden.
However, if I was constructing a special bed for alpines, I would not hesitate to put weed fabric under the sand, gravel, and stone to prevent mixing and invasion by rhizomatous weeds.Rick seems to be following Lori's lead.
I will respond to Rick's comments below.Quote from: RickR on January 21, 2012, 01:54:25 AMFor most rock gardeners who garden on the land (as opposed to pots and troughs), a rock garden is not an assemblage of stagnant plants.
By this I mean plants that are planted and grown, perhaps even to perfection, but the landscape and plants are unchanging: always X number of plants, Y number of species, placed in their designated spots only, and not allowed to naturalize.
There is nothing wrong with this type of gardening, but to claim that this is the norm by quoting the booklet A Rock Garden Handbook for Beginners in your support, is erroneous.Using weed fabric does not leave the garden unchanging.
It is true that seedlings are prevented from establishing.
However, competition from adult plants typically prevents new seedling establishment irregardless of whether weed fabric is utilized.
For rhizomatous perennials like Monardas and Coreopsis auriculata I must regularly cut away the weed fabric if I want them to expand.
Some plants like Penstemon cardinalis have a certain number of individuals that die for no apparent reason each year.
This gives me the opportunity to put a new plant in a vacant spot.
I am always moving stuff around in the garden.
The weed fabric does not stop me from changing the garden.
It is just a way to help me reduce maintenance.Mark is commenting on his specific situation.
If sand, gravel, or some other special growing medium is not being used then the need for a barrier to separate it from the native soil has been eliminated.
A good mulching with leaves would be just as effective for reducing weeds in a woodland garden.
In fact, a mulching with leaves would be better because it would break down and feed the soil over time.
Mark also may not need weed fabric because his garden is mature.
It is really only beneficial to use weed fabric under mulch when making a new bed.
The weed fabric smothers the weeds, weed seedlings, and grass (in the case of lawn).
Once the existing vegetation has died, holes can be cut in the fabric and plants can be planted.
Over time the weed seed bank is reduced and the plants fill in helping prevent weeds from establishing.
Once the garden has matured, then it may be desirable to ripe up the weed fabric.
It does take some effort to maintain the weed fabric.
This would not be worth the expenditure once the biggest threat from weeds has passed.
I would still maintain about a foot of fabric around a bed to help keep the rhizomatous grasses from creeping into it.The need for weed fabric can be eliminated by turning the soil over, which smothers the weeds and seeds by burial.
I have done this many times and it is a lot of work.
Herbicide can be used to kill the existing vegetation (without turning the soil), however weed seedlings may still be a problem for a number of years using only this method.
A surface weed barrier would also be unnecessary for a new garden bed made by laying weed free sand, gravel, growing mix, etc. over the existing soil.
It still is beneficial to use some sort of membrane to prevent the growing medium and native soil from mixing.
This membrane will also help prevent any weeds that are capable of pushing through the thick layer of growing medium from emerging.Another reason I like weed fabric is because it helps keep my garden plants from growing into access corridors I use for maintenance or to cross a bed.
Rhizomatous plants, like many Monardas, will take over an entire area given the chance.
The weed fabric helps keep them in place.
They will still creep under the fabric and try to invade their neighbor's space, but it is easier to remove these few stems when the space where spread can occur is limited.

We differ in that respect then.
I view even our subjective perceptions of meaning to be significant in an objective way.
Given that there could have been beings capable of perceiving things or there could not have (and the latter seems somehow more plausible), it seems probable to me that the meaning we attach to things like life, morality, love, etc. was intended to be.
Maybe this extrapolation is foolish, or maybe it's not.
I don't claim to know, but I do know what I believe.

1 Corinthians 8:1
He did not say, Your liberty has become a stumbling-block, nor did he positively affirm it that he might not make them more shameless; but how?
Take heed; frightening them, and making them ashamed, and leading them to disavow any such conduct.
And he said not, This your knowledge, which would have sounded more like praise; nor this your perfectness; but, your liberty; a thing which seemed to savor more of rashness and obstinacy and arrogance.
Neither said he, To the brethren, but, To those of the brethren who are weak; enhancing his accusation from their not even sparing the weak, and those too their brethren.
For let it be so that you correct them not, nor arouse them: yet why trip them up, and make them to stumble, when you ought to stretch out the hand?
But for that you have no mind: well then, at least avoid casting them down.
Since if one were wicked, he required punishment; if weak, healing: but now he is not only weak, but also a brother.
And through your meat he that is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.

On March 18, 1925, the twister later dubbed the "Tri-State Tornado" killed almost 700 people and spread destruction across the American Midwest, becoming the deadliest such natural disaster in U.S. history.
The following day, an Associated Press article in The Manitowoc Herald-News of Manitowoc, Wis., tried to assess the damage.
"Dead estimated at 500 to 1000.
Injured estimated at 2500 to 3000.
Homeless estimated at 8000 to 10,000.
"A mid-afternoon tornado, the worst hour to strike, when children were packed in schools and workers in stores and shops, yesterday's storm, in five mid-western states still held many victims buried and unreported today.
"When it did the worst damage the tornado lasted less than five minutes.
It flattened heavily constructed schools and business dwellings with worse results than the casualties in lighter dwellings.
Babies in homes were special sufferers."

To my surprise I encounter more often than not a healthy, vibrant, generous, talented, and humble young man inquiring about a possible vocation to the priesthood, whether it be for a religious institute or the Diocese of Fort Worth.
Little by little names and individuals trickle toward the Vocations Office to inquire about how to deal with a deep desire to know Christ and serve his Church with magnanimity.
Who wouldn't be impressed?
Thousands of people filled the basilica, which was decorated with white roses, small yellow flowers and evergreens.
In the crowd was a group of children wearing colorful capes and cardboard crowns in memory of the three kings who traveled to Bethlehem; three of the children brought offertory gifts to the pope.
Pope Benedict also tweeted a special blessing in eight languages to his more than 2 million Twitter followers: "May Our Lord bless you and watch over you in the new year."
Customer: "Why is this so hard?
You tell me how much gas I need, and I give you the money!"

Yesterday, I enjoyed the sights and sounds surrounding me.
It was a hot, dry, windy day in the desert.
The birds were enjoying life.
I wish you could hear the sounds made by the birds singing and flitting about my yard.

With all her heart, Mrs. Skipper said; but she had an errand, though it was not to bring cider or hot bread.
She had learned the secret of making potato-bread: not the doughy, distasteful stuff that many people were eating, but light, digestible, palatable bread.
She would not tell the secret to everybody, - giving away her own trade; but when she saw a family of old friends eating potatoes, morning, noon, and night, she could not help telling them how they might get something better.

VI. - The decrees of the Metropolitan Court of Justice shall be final, except such on account of which censure shall have been past on the judge by a decree of the National Assembly, in manner hereinafter specified.
Art.
XIV. - But in such cases it behoves the judge to be upon his guard against causes collusively removed to a distant scene, for the purpose of prejudging the interest of a third person: and in such case, besides applying, should the case admit of it, the punishment appointed for this sort of fraudulent attempt, it behoves him, by suitable notices and publications, to render the success of it impracticable elsewhere.
Art.
XXVIII. - Complaints of misbehaviour on the part of a judge in the execution of his office, and petitions for expedition on his part in a cause depending before him, shall be preferred only to the court of appeal to which his court is immediately subject.
This extends to deputes permanent, as well as to principals.

It had never occurred to me to make my own fabric labels, and yet you make it look so simple and achievable ... thank you so much!Dawn
Hi Anne: I think you will have to experiment at first.
Since I do not have the same paper as you, the time may be different.
I ironed mine probably only for about 10 seconds with a hot iron and very firm pressure but always moving the iron back and forth along the ribbon.
I hope this helps:o)
This is awesome.
I'd been considering for the longest time about getting some custom labels made for my stuff but you're right-they can get pricey and they're not always so finessed to one's own individual taste.
I had considered the transfer paper already but your suggestion about the ribbon is so much more efficient than what I had in mind, which was just some old fabric.
Thank you so much!
I wanted to make a quilt label and this is exactly what I was looking for!
Now I want to make my friends some personalized gift ribbons for their holiday packages.
Fun!

Once you've decided on a CPU, you'll want to look at the different chip sets that support that type of processor.
The chip set provides the core logic and manages the motherboard's functions.
Several companies (including ATI, Intel, and nVidia) make motherboard chip sets, most of which offer the same basic features.
The variants of nVidia's nForce4 chip set were the most widely used on the boards we looked at, though Intel's 975X Express has become increasingly popular for Intel-based motherboards.

Here is how it works: Company ABC and PEO ABC agree on a relationship whereby both companies employ the employees of Company ABC and split the various responsibilities of being an employer.
Company ABC will be considered the worksite employer, and will retain all responsibilities of managing employees in their day-to-day activities: when to show up, what to do, how much they're paid, etc.
PEO ABC will be considered the employer of record, and will be responsible for filing payroll taxes, managing unemployment and workers comp claims, as well as administering the employee benefit plans.

Carcinogens are also responsible for causing several types of cancer.
Carcinogens can include toxic chemicals, radiation, and tumor viruses.
These viruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses and infect previously healthy cells by integrating their DNA into the target cell, thereby altering the cell's DNA.
This now abnormal cell then becomes an oncogene and has the ability to cause cancer.
It is also suspected that other factors, such as the immune system, have a hand in causing certain types of cancer.
Suppressed or deficient immune systems, whether caused by old age or a medical condition, can increase a dog's risk of developing some forms of this disease.
In addition, it is thought that hormones may occasionally play a role in causing cancer.
However, many factors may be responsible for the development of this disease in an individual dog, and pinpointing a specific cause may be difficult or impossible.

MiamiReuters - Wed, May 22, 2013By Barbara Liston ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - An 18-foot, 8-inch Burmese python set a record for the longest snake ever captured in South Florida, where the exotic species has taken up residence.
College student Jason Leon snared the female python in a rural area southeast of Miami earlier this month, when he saw part of it sticking out from brush along the roadside, said Carli Segelson, a spokeswoman for the state's Fish and Wildlife Commission. ...A gnome grows in Chelsea - at the flower show, that isReuters - Tue, May 21, 2013By Paul Casciato LONDON (Reuters) - Some spectators at London's Chelsea Flower Show wouldn't be caught dead with one in the trunk of their Bentley, but garden gnomes have turned up at the show's 100th edition this year, for charity.

Conventional wisdom tells us that women can do anything men can.
With rare exception owing to strength or stature, this is true.
But we don't always want to do what men do, and even if and when we do we have to account for our biology.
Sometimes it is the strength and stature deficit, sometimes it is our heavier role in reproduction.
The feminist intelligentsia thinks this unfair, so, couching their advice in terms of equality, they tell us to ignore biology.
Accordingly, the female heroes who we admire today are the ones who work around reality.
A Disappointing Marvel Panel At San Diego Comic Con Announced
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of Burroughs" first novel, A Princess of Mars, the book upon which John Carter is largely based.
Burroughs, or ERB, is more familiar to many as the creator of Tarzan of the Apes, one of the most recognizable and enduring figures in pop culture history.
Born in 1875 in the wake of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, ERB has been called by many the father of American science fiction.
His 60+ novels, ripping tales of high adventure set everywhere from the earth's core to the African veldt to the jungles of Venus, served as inspiration for countless writers and scientists from Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury to Carl Sagan and Jane Goodall.

From Eric Lee:
By 1942 the Germans realised that four of the recruits (William Murphy, Patrick O'Brien, Andrew Walsh and our old friend Thomas "Red" Cushing) were not quite as loyal to the Reich as originally thought.
The four were sent to a segregation unit in Saschenhausen concentration camp.

Transcribed by Alun Morgan for the Revolutionary History Website.
The articles he wrote for Tribune between 1943 and 1947 are gathered into a single volume with an excellent introduction by Paul Anderson.[...] publication of the Tribune articles is useful because Orwell wrote for the paper at a time when he was writing Animal Farm and thinking about Nineteen Eighty-Four.
His article on Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, a book which is sometimes seen as a model for Nineteen Eighty-Four, appeared in January 1946, though any reader of the Tribune articles will conclude that Burnham's The Managerial Revolution was a more important influence on Orwell's thinking.

How to Heal: 29 Holy Priest
Renew is next up on the list, and even with no haste at all you can see that it heals for (62 x (12/3=4) = 248) 248 over 12 seconds.
The drawback of course is that you have to wait the full 12 seconds before you get that healing.
Finally we have Heal which is your cheapest and least effect per-cast heal.
Don't dismiss this one for the low healing value though, because that cheap mana cost makes it one of the best healing options available to you.
If you don't need a big heal right away then Heal is much better than Flash Heal for its low mana cost alone.

Diagnosis of the type of glomerular disease that causes the nephrotic syndrome is necessary for appropriate treatment and typically requires a renal biopsy.
The goal of this study was to identify candidate protein biomarkers to diagnose glomerular diseases.
Proteomic methods and informatic analysis were used to identify patterns of urine proteins that are characteristic of the diseases.
Urine proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis in 32 patients with FSGS, lupus nephritis, membranous nephropathy, or diabetic nephropathy.
Protein abundances from 16 patients were used to train an artificial neural network to create a prediction algorithm.
The remaining 16 patients were used as an external validation set to test the accuracy of the prediction algorithm.
In the validation set, the model predicted the presence of the diseases with sensitivities between 75 and 86% and specificities from 92 to 67%.
The probability of obtaining these results in the novel set by chance is 5 x 10 (-8).
Twenty-one gel spots were most important for the differentiation of the diseases.
The spots were cut from the gel, and 20 were identified by mass spectrometry as charge forms of 11 plasma proteins: Orosomucoid, transferrin, alpha-1 microglobulin, zinc alpha-2 glycoprotein, alpha-1 antitrypsin,

Other Sections▼AbstractMATERIALS AND METHODSRESULTSDISCUSSIONREFERENCESAbstractWe recently showed that resistance exercise and ingestion of essential amino acids with carbohydrate (EAA+CHO) can independently stimulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and muscle protein synthesis in humans.
Providing an EAA+CHO solution postexercise can further increase muscle protein synthesis.
Therefore, we hypothesized that enhanced mTOR signaling might be responsible for the greater muscle protein synthesis when leucine-enriched EAA+CHOs are ingested during postexercise recovery.
Sixteen male subjects were randomized to one of two groups (control or EAA+CHO).
The EAA+CHO group ingested the nutrient solution 1 h after resistance exercise. mTOR signaling was assessed by immunoblotting from repeated muscle biopsy samples.
Mixed muscle fractional synthetic rate (FSR) was measured using stable isotope techniques.
Muscle protein synthesis and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation during exercise were significantly reduced (P < 0.05).
Postexercise FSR was elevated above baseline in both groups at 1 h but was even further elevated in the EAA+CHO group at 2 h postexercise (P < 0.05).
Increased FSR was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K1 (P < 0.05).
Akt phosphorylation was elevated at 1 h and returned to baseline by 2 h in the control group, but it remained elevated in the EAA+CHO group (P < 0.05).
4E-BP1 phosphorylation returned to baseline during recovery in control but became elevated when EAA+CHO was ingested (P < 0.05). eEF2 phosphorylation decreased at 1 and 2 h postexercise to a similar extent in both groups (P < 0.05).
Our data suggest that enhanced activation of the mTOR signaling pathway is playing a role in the greater synthesis of muscle proteins when resistance exercise is followed by EAA+CHO ingestion.Keywords: muscle protein synthesis, mammalian target of rapamycin, essential amino acids Other Sections▼AbstractMATERIALS AND METHODSRESULTSDISCUSSIONREFERENCES IT IS NOW WIDELY ACCEPTED that skeletal muscle contraction in the form of resistance-type exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis during postexercise recovery.
The positive effect of resistance exercise on muscle protein synthesis has been measured in as little as 1 h postexercise (18) and may last for up to 24 h in trained (34) and 48 h in untrained subjects (37).
Increases in muscle protein synthesis are likely to be mediated, in part, through changes in muscle cell signaling.
In particular, resistance exercise appears to elicit its effects by signal transduction through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway leading to phosphorylation and activation of its down-stream target proteins, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (3, 4, 9, 10).We (18) recently showed that the mTOR signaling pathway is activated during and after a single bout of resistance exercise, which was associated with a significant increase in muscle protein synthesis.
Those data showed that mTOR signaling was stimulated at a time when the fractional synthesis rate (FSR), a direct measure of muscle protein synthesis, of mixed muscle proteins was elevated 41% above baseline after 2 h of postexercise recovery.
Others (3, 17, 25) also have shown a positive response to resistance exercise with regard to mTOR signaling, but interpretation of the results and direct comparisons are difficult because of differences in study design such as number of sets and repetitions, differences in mode of contraction (concentric vs. eccentric), and intensity.Essential amino acids (EAA), particularly leucine, also have been shown to activate the mTOR signaling pathway, which turns on the translational machinery necessary for muscle protein synthesis in both rodent and human models (1, 2, 27).
Recently, it was shown that EAA apparently activate mTOR via a unique class 3 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), hVps34, which stimulates mTOR by an unknown mechanism, bypassing the insulin-induced activation of mTOR through Akt (14, 35).
However, mTOR activation due to nutrient intake of both essential amino acids and carbohydrate (EAA+CHO) may be accomplished via the insulin-stimulated signaling pathway through PI3K-Akt-TSC2 as well as the insulin-independent amino acid-induced pathway just described (i.e., hVps34).More recently, we measured mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis after ingestion of a leucine enriched EAA+CHO solution (21).
After ingestion of EAA+CHO, muscle protein synthesis increased ~100% within 1 h (21).
The rapid increase in muscle protein synthesis was associated with a significant increase in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of downstream components S6K1 and 4E-BP1, indicating that translation initiation was enhanced.
In addition, eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) phosphorylation decreased significantly compared with base-line, suggesting that elongation of translation was also stimulated by this leucine-enriched "anabolic" nutrient solution (21).Postexercise nutrient ingestion, in the form of EAA alone or in combination with carbohydrate (EAA+CHO) has clearly shown that muscle protein synthesis is elevated above that measured following resistance exercise alone (5, 11-13, 29, 38, 39, 41).
However, the mechanisms for the enhanced synthesis of muscle proteins following exercise with ingestion of EAA+CHO have not been determined.
Our goal was to explore potential mechanisms for the augmented muscle protein synthesis observed when leucine-enriched EAA+CHO are ingested during postexercise recovery.
We hypothesized that ingestion of a leucine-enriched EAA+CHO solution during postexercise recovery would result in enhanced mTOR signaling and greater muscle protein synthesis than recovery without nutrients.
Other Sections▼AbstractMATERIALS AND METHODSRESULTSDISCUSSIONREFERENCESMATERIALS AND METHODSSubjectsWe studied 16 young healthy males who reported that they were not currently engaged in a resistance exercise training program during the screening interview.
In addition, all volunteers were asked to refrain from performing vigorous physical activity for 24 h before participating in the study.
All subjects gave informed written consent before participating in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch (which is in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki).
Screening of subjects was performed with clinical history, physical exam, and laboratory tests including complete blood count with differential, liver and kidney function tests, coagulation profile, fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test, hepatitis B and C screening, human immunodeficiency virus test, TSH, lipid profile, urinalysis, drug screening, and ECG.
The subjects" physical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.Table 1Physical characteristics of subjectsStudy designDetails of the cross-sectional study design have been published previously (18).
Briefly, each subject's one repetition maximum (1RM) was determined on two separate occasions on a leg extension machine (Cybex-VR2; Medway, MA), which was located within the General Clinical Research Center's (GCRC) exercise laboratory and used for each study.
The 1RM values obtained were used to determine the starting weight (70% of 1RM) for the resistance exercise portion of our study.
In addition, a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan (Hologic QDR 4500W; Bedford, MA) was performed to measure body composition and lean mass.Each subject was admitted to the GCRC of the University of Texas Medical Branch the day before the exercise study.
All subjects were instructed to refrain from physical exercise for 24 h before arriving and to maintain their regular diet before study participation.
The subjects were all fed a standardized meal (12 kcal/kg body wt; 60% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 20% protein) prepared by the Bionutrition Division of the GCRC.
Each subject was also offered a snack at 2200 and did not eat again until the study the following day.
The snack was provided at 2200 to avoid prolonged fasting during the study the following day, since subjects in the control group would not ingest food until the study was completed (~18 h).The morning of the study, polyethylene catheters were inserted into a forearm vein for tracer infusion, in the contralateral hand vein, which was heated, for arterialized blood sampling, and in the femoral artery and vein (retrograde placement) of the leg for blood sampling.
The femoral lines were placed in the same leg from which muscle biopsies were obtained.
The arterial catheter was also used for the infusion of indocyanine green (ICG; Akorn, Buffalo Grove, IL) to determine blood flow.After a background blood sample was drawn, a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) was begun (time 0) and was maintained at a constant rate until the end of the experiment (Fig.
1).
The priming dose for the labeled phenylalanine was 2

State leaders should immediately convene a summit of leaders from state agencies and cities that generate electricity for resale to explore opportunities for cost-based forward contracts with the utilities.
Government agencies control about one-quarter of the state's power generation and resell about 40 million mega watt hours (MWh) each year.
Though their loads are very seasonal, if even 10 to 20 percent of that load could be forwarded to the utilities at cost, it would help push forward prices down and lever additional contracts.
Gradually, but predictably, raise the price caps.
Convene a working group to create an initial schedule and revise the schedule periodically as market conditions change.

In October 1991, Berman and Piller began developing the new series and they decided to set it in the same time frame as The Next Generation - a decision made consciously to take advantage of the Star Trek universe that had so far been established.
Berman and Piller wrote several different versions of the series bible while it was being developed.
When they finally showed a later version to Paramount, the studio provided its own input into the project and in fact Brandon Tarticoff, before he left Paramount, suggested that the show might be something like The Rifleman in outer space, although Berman and Piller did not quite feel that this idea particularly fit in with what they were trying to develop.
But the studio's suggestions were weighed and incorporated into the series concept to produce the final result.
"That's the 35th Rule."

Former NBA star Charles Barkley drove in from Atlanta to watch Cousins for the first time.
For awhile Cousins had considered signing with Alabama-Birmingham to play for Mike Davis, but by that point he was ready to leave the state.
He said he needed a fresh start, and it's tough to get a fresh start in an old place where people harp on your past instead of offering encouraging words about your future.
As he answered, Cousins activated the speaker so some visitors could hear.

Routine maintenance is reduced, in so far as there is no degradation of shift caused by degradation of cable inners and outers.
OK, the battery needs to be charged, so that might be seen as an additional maintenance hassle not present with mechanical, so maybe that's a neutral point.

Antonio the Scofflaw: Freebies, Gifts and Favors - It's All Part of the Job
Home Shipping & Returns
This weekend saw what will likely be the least appealing set of releases of the year.
Between the unsurprising awfulness of House at the End of the Street, the bland looking Trouble with the Curve, and the apparently well-acted but hard to watch The Master, the only two choices I was left with were action movies (a genre which has covered 5 of my last 6 reviews).
Since I had already seen Dredd, I decided to spend my miniscule amount of free time for the week on End of Watch.
I'm not a big fan of the recent wave of the found footage format (Paramormal Activity, Cloverfield, Quarantine, etc.), but in light of a respectable Rotten Tomatoes score and favorable word of mouth from some of my fellow bloggers I tried to stay cautiously optimistic.
I am happy to say that despite some pacing issues and an unremarkable set of antagonists, End of Watch benefits from strong performances from the two leads and the best use of the found footage format in recent memory.
As I mentioned before, I tend to stay away from most of the recent wave of found footage style movies that have been coming out in droves since the success of the Paranormal Activities movies.
While I do admit that from a business standpoint it is more or less a slam dunk as intentionally filming a movie from a camcorder drastically lowers a film's required budget, from an audience standpoint I don't enjoy the nauseating task of following the simulated jerky, shaky cinematography of an amateur cameraman.
In End of Watch, however, there is a great balance between pocket cams, handheld video recorders, squad car cams and general cinematic shots.
The fact that we periodically switch between Point of View camera angles and traditional filming makes it so that we never have time to get tired of one style or the other.
If anything, the mixture does great favors for the film's action sequences; making ever heavy breath, every bead of sweat and every received or returned gunshot feel like it is in our own world rather than theirs.

The Sunday
Dave Brubeck, a pianist and composer whose distinctive mixture of experimentation and accessibility made him one of the most popular jazz musicians of the 1950s and �60s, died Wednesday morning in Norwalk, Conn.
He would have turned 92 on Thursday.He died while on his way to a cardiology appointment, Russell Gloyd, his producer, conductor and manager for 36 years, said.
Brubeck lived in Wilton, Conn.In a long and successful career, Brubeck helped repopularize jazz at a time when younger listeners had been trained to the sonic dimensions of the three-minute pop single.
His quartet�s 1959 recording of �Take Five� was the first jazz single to sell a million copies.Brubeck experimented with time signatures and polytonality and explored musical theater and the oratorio, baroque compositional devices and foreign modes.
But he did not always please the critics, who often described his music as schematic, bombastic and � a word he particularly disliked � stolid.
His very stubbornness and strangeness � the polytonality, the blockiness of his playing, the oppositional push-and-pull between his piano and Paul Desmond�s alto saxophone � makes the Brubeck quartet�s best work still sound original.Outside of the group�s most famous originals, which had the charm and durability of pop songs (�Time Out,� �Blue Rondo a la Turk,� �It�s a Raggy Waltz�), some of its best work was in its overhauls of standards like �You Go to My Head,� �All the Things You Are� and �Pennies From Heaven.�David Warren Brubeck was born on Dec.
6, 1920, in Concord, Calif., near San Francisco.
Surrounded by farms, his family lived a bucolic life: His father, Pete, was a cattle buyer for a meat company, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a choir director at the nearby Presbyterian church.
When Brubeck was 11, the family moved to Ione, Calif., where his father managed a 45,000-acre cattle ranch and owned his own 1,200 acres.At the College of the Pacific, near Stockton, Calif., he first studied to be a veterinarian but switched to music after a year.
It was there that he learned about 20th-century culture and read about Freud, Marx and serial music; it was also there that he met Iola Whitlock, a fellow student, who became his wife in 1942.He graduated that year and was immediately drafted.
For two years he played with the Army band at Camp Haan, in Southern California.
In 1944 Pvt. Brubeck became a rifleman, entering basic training � first in Texas, then in Maryland � and was shortly sent to Metz, in eastern France, for further preparation for combat.When his new commanding officer heard him accompany a Red Cross traveling show one day, Brubeck recalled, he told his aide-de-camp, �I don�t want that boy to go to the front.� Thereafter, Brubeck led a band that was trucked into combat areas to play for the troops.
He was near the front twice, during the Battle of the Bulge, but he never fought.Finished with the Army at 25, Brubeck moved with his wife into an apartment in Oakland, Calif., and, on a G.I. Bill scholarship, studied at Mills College with the French composer Darius Milhaud.
Milhaud asked the jazz musicians in his class to write fugues for jazz ensembles, and Brubeck played the results at a series of performances at Mills College.
Brubeck had such admiration for his teacher that he named his first son, born in 1947, Darius.Brubeck had met his most important musical colleague, Paul Desmond, in an Army band in 1943.
Desmond was a perfect foil; his lovely, impassive tone was as ethereal as Brubeck�s style was densely chorded.
In 1947 they met again and found instant musical rapport, fascinated by the challenge of using counterpoint in jazz.Brubeck�s first group, an octet formed in 1946, contained five of Milhaud�s students and played pieces influenced by his teachings, using canonlike elements.
The group�s earliest recorded work predated a much more famous set of similarly temperate jazz recordings, the 1948-50 Miles Davis Nonet work later packaged as �Birth of the Cool.�In the late 1940s and early �50s Brubeck also led a trio with Ron Crotty on bass and Cal Tjader on drums.
It was around this time that he started to develop an audience.
He was given an initial boost by the San Francisco disc jockey Jimmy Lyons, later the founder of the Monterey Jazz Festival, who plugged the band on KNBC radio and helped secure it a record deal with the Coronet label.In 1951 the trio expanded to a quartet, with Desmond returning.
(The permanent lineup change was perhaps inevitable, as Desmond was desperate to join his old friend�s increasingly popular band, but it may also have had to do with physical necessity: Brubeck had suffered a serious neck injury while swimming in Hawaii, limiting his dexterity, and he needed another soloist to help carry the music.)
Quickly the constitutionally different men � Brubeck open, ambitious and imposing; Desmond private, profligate and self-effacing � developed their lines of musical communication.
By the time of an engagement in Boston in the fall of 1952 they had become one of jazz�s greatest combinations.In 1958, as part of a State Department program that brought jazz as an offer of good will during the Cold War, his quartet traveled in the Middle East and India, and Brubeck became intrigued by musical languages that didn�t stick to 4/4 time � what he called �march-style jazz,� the meter that had been the music�s bedrock.
The result was the album �Time Out,� recorded in 1959.
With the hits �Take Five� (composed by Desmond in 5/4 meter) and �Blue Rondo a la Turk� (composed by Brubeck in 9/8), the album propelled Brubeck onto the pop charts.Initially, Brubeck said, the album was released without high expectations from the record company.
But when disc jockeys in the Midwest started playing �Take Five,� the song became a national phenomenon.
After the album had been out for 18 months, Columbia released �Take Five� as a 45 rpm single, edited for radio, with �Blue Rondo� on the B side.
Both album and single became hits; �Time Out� has since sold close to 2 million copies.In 1960, realizing that most of the quartet�s work centered on the East Coast, the Brubecks, with their children, Dan, Michael, Chris, Darius and Catherine, moved to Wilton.
They stayed there permanently and later had one more child, Matthew.In 1968 he formed a quartet with the baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, and later he began working with his musician sons Darius (a pianist), Chris (a bassist), Dan (a drummer) and Matthew (a cellist).
He performed and recorded with them often, most definitively on �In Their Own Sweet Way,� a Telarc album from 1997.
The classic Brubeck quartet regrouped only once, in 1976, for a 25th-anniversary tour.Brubeck�s son Michael died a few years ago.
In addition to his other sons, Brubeck is survived by his wife, Iola; a daughter, Catherine Yaghsizian; 10 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.Brubeck resumed working with a quartet in the late 1970s � finally settling into a long-term touring group featuring the saxophonist Bobby Militello � and thereafter never stopped writing, touring and performing his hits.
To the end he was a major draw at festivals.In 1999 Brubeck was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.
Ten years later he received a Kennedy Center Honor for his contribution to American culture.
He gave his archives to his alma mater, now renamed the University of the Pacific.Despite health problems, Brubeck was still working as recently as 2011.
In November 2010, just a month after undergoing heart surgery and receiving a pacemaker, he performed at the Blue Note in Manhattan.
Nate Chinen of The Times, noting that Brubeck had already �softened his pianism, replacing the old hammer-and-anvil attack with something almost airy,� wrote that his playing at the Blue Note �was the picture of judicious clarity, its well-placed chordal accents suggesting a riffing horn section.�

As you may have noticed, I've been blogging less than usual these last few days.
Usually, when that happens, you can expect one of my chatty "What I had for breakfast/lunch/dinner" posts, which serve as the blogger's equivalent of the contact call of the black-capped chickadee.
In this case, instead of the little bird poking...

The Sydney eScholarship Repository /
Technological advances in recent decades have seen our ability to both record and archive these sounds advance steadily, as witnessed by the many new tools and projects discussed at this workshop.
Yet the other side of language - what these recordings mean - remains problematic, and presents difficult problems for archiving that receive all too little discussion.
The worst case - found all too often - is an immaculate sound recording of a passage in language, without translation - for a language about which little is known this is about as helpful as tablets in the Indus or other undeciphered scripts: we recognize that language is there, without knowing what it means.
Such cases can result either from language materials that are recorded without being analysed, or through a prevalent asymmetry by which the original text is recorded, but not the process of arriving at a translation through subsequent discussion and probing.

Solid composite is a blending of both solid and engineered technologies to create a more stable product in wider widths.
Utilizing strips of solid 3/4" wood 1-2 inches in width, these strips are glued together into a single wide plank.
The separation of grain direction into these narrow strips reduces the strength of any one strip, allowing the entire plank to be resistant to cupping, crowning or bowing.
This product can be made from the leftover material when standard width boards are cut to size.
Most of this left over material is usually ground up into sawdust.
This post-industrial recycling of this material is a better use of the natural resources.

Alex Prentice QC, the Advocate Depute then rose to begin his cross-examination and began by asking the witness what the purpose of her alleged meeting with Colin Fox was.
Ms Lang responded that "he had asked to meet with us" and repeated her previous statement that at the meeting Mr Fox had stated his intention to "clear out the executive, the SSY and the Voice."
Mr Prentice asked if Mr Fox had said anything about his forthcoming testimony at the defamation case between Tommy Sheridan and the News of the World (which was due to start in July that year) and Ms Lang said Colin Fox had said he was going to "tell the truth" and say Tommy Sheridan had made no admissions at the 9/11/04 meeting.
Mr Prentice put it to the witness that "the truth is he did not say Tommy Sheridan denied the allegations" to which Ms Lang replied "no."

Global warming: we haven't been studying the weather long enough as a species to be able to say with any validity that humans are the cause of increased temperatures in the last few years.
I'm not sure we've been studying it long enough to claim that temperatures are rising in the first place, instead of undergoing normal long-term variation.
It's possible the cycle is longer than the hundred years we've been keeping records.
It's possible the sun's output is varying, as evidenced by warm-ups detected on Mars and Jupiter.
And most importantly, the entire issue has become politicized and death-knelled by a man seeking relevance and his willing sycophants for too long for anyone to think rationally about it anymore.
We should not be making national policy based on a doomsday boogeyman.
That said, some of the things suggested as ways to combat global warming are good ideas anyway, such as recycling, as long as they don't become mandatory.

Before planting a garden, it is necessary to learn to observe, to get to know the terrain, local varieties and water sources.
The garden has to be adapted to the characteristics of the area and local raw materials should be used to make the fencing, the compost bin and the nursery.

Inappropriateness (Why did the space shuttle Challenger blow up?
The astronauts were free-basing Tang) - okay, maybe this one is inappropriateness/tragedy + time.
You get the point - it's just like how the London newspaper headline read during World War II, BRITISH PUSH BOTTLES UP GERMANS.
Whether inadvertent or deliberate, or a combination of both, these jokes simultaneously manage to remain innocent and raunchy at the same time.
Something the majority of us, despite any rigidity, can't help but chuckle at...

Stephen Darmody,
I like to leave politics to other blogs, but I did note these strong words about the federal judiciary spoken yesterday from our favorite cranky old guy:"With a presumption that would have amazed the framers of our Constitution, and legal reasoning that would have mystified them, federal judges today issue rulings and opinions on policy questions that should be decided democratically.
Assured of lifetime tenures, these judges show little regard for the authority of the president, the Congress and the states.
They display even less interest in the will of the people."That's right - who cares about the will of the people?
"Get over it.
It's so old by now!"

The most important thing a designer needs to have is a good taste.
A good taste at identifying great work.
It doesn't matter if your work doesn't match up with your taste yet.
It will slowly but steadily catch up.
Ultimately your taste ends up defining your style.
In fact your taste will be few steps ahead of your talent in the initial years of your career.
Your taste can tell the difference in quality between what you want to make and what you have made.

2 I am looking to include a reference to a non-elisp file (a small Python program), and would like to be able to say "it is in the same directory as the current file, but with a different file name."
In many scripting languages, there are things like __FILE__ (in PHP) for getting an absolute path to the current file.

I am in the middle of making jackets for my children and would love some of your fabric scraps to line pockets, collars, sew together to make patchwork bias binding (how cute that will look) and to make appliques of their choosing to individualise their jackets.
I have only just started sewing again and don't have any fabric scraps so would love yours.
Great giveaway idea!
I am making linen bags for my daughters toys.
I would use the scraps for the appliques.

His hand went to his cheek, rubbing slowly as he looked at her.
A wicked smile coming across his face.
He moved quickly, startling her as he grabbed her nightgown and ripped it at the straps, causing it to fall to the floor.
She stood naked in front of him. "now...THAT wasn't nice...."
His right hand shot out and grabbed her hair roughly....pulling her closer and tilting her head up.
His mouth pressed against hers as his other hand pushed between her legs....turning slightly and moving upward to cup her sex.
She felt his fingers sliding over her pussy in a slow, back and forth motion.
Parting her lips with his fingers.
She groaned into his mouth as his tongue slid into hers.
The sensation of his fingers touching her sending waves rolling through her.
Her eyes closed tightly, trying to deny what was happening.
Murmuring protests against his mouth.
She felt his mouth move to her neck.
Moving down to her shoulder slowly, kissing and biting softly, each one sending a sensation rolling through her she had to remind herself not to give into.
His mouth moved from one side of her neck to the other...his one hand in her hair, holding her in place as his other hand rubbed her pussy slowly.
She could feel herself growing wet, closing her eyes tightly, trying to will him to stop.
Suddenly his fingers pressed against her clit and rubbed in a slow...small circle.
She tried not to, but she groaned in pleasure. "ooohhhhhh" echoed in the kitchen.
His fingers rubbed slow and steady for a moment before sliding back down to rub her lips.
"Pl...Pl...Please.....please stop....John....please..." she groaned as his mouth moved along her neck and shoulders.
His fingers rubbing her slowly...sending waves of pleasure rolling through her as she shook her head "no."
She felt him smile against her skin...his mouth moving up towards her ear.
She felt his hand twist between her thighs...forcing her to open them slightly.
Then...suddenly, she felt his finger slide into her.
She felt it sink into her slowly...opening her.
"Oh goddd nooooo....."
Her hands went to his hips...thinking to push him away, but all they did was tighten on his sides.
She felt his finger slide into her fully....roll inside her and pull back slowly...then push in again...he repeated this action over and over.
Each time, slow....letting her feel every bit of her body opening to his touch.
"Oh god...please....please stop....John....please....you can't do this....plea..ea...ea..sseee..."
